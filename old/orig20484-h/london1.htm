    CHAPTER I
</h2>
<pre>
          Triumphant returning at night with the spoil,
          Like Bachanals, shouting and gay:
          How sweet with a bottle and song to refresh,
          And lose the fatigues of the day.
          With sport, wit, and wine, fickle fortune defy,
          Dull 'wisdom all happiness sours;
          Since Life is no more than a passage at best,
          Let's strew the way over with flowers.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[1]</span>"THEY order these things better in London," replied the Hon. Tom
Dashall, to an old weather-beaten sportsman, who would fain have made a
convert of our London <i>Sprig of Fashion</i> to the sports and delights of
rural life. The party were regaling themselves after the dangers and
fatigues of a very hard day's fox-chace; and, while the sparkling glass
circulated, each, anxious to impress on the minds of the company the
value of the exploits and amusements in which he felt most delight,
became more animated and boisterous in his oratory&mdash;forgetting that
excellent regulation which forms an article in some of the rules and
orders of our "<i>Free and Easies</i>" in London, "that no more than three
gentlemen shall be allowed to speak at the same time." The whole party,
consisting of fourteen, like a pack in full cry, had, with the kind
assistance of the "rosy god," become at the same moment most animated,
not to say vociferous, orators. The young squire, Bob Tally ho, (as he
was called) of Belville Hall, who had recently come into possession of
this fine and extensive domain, was far from feeling indifferent to the
pleasures of a sporting life, and, in the chace, had even acquired the
reputation of being a "keen sportsman:" but the regular intercourse
which took place between him and his cousin, the Hon. Tom Dashall, of
Bond Street notoriety, had in <span class="pagenum">[2]</span>some measure led to an indecision
of character, and often when perusing the lively and fascinating
descriptions which the latter drew of the passing scenes in the
gay metropolis, Bob would break out into an involuntary exclamation
of&mdash;"Curse me, but after all, this only is Real Life; "&mdash;while, for the
moment, horses, dogs, and gun, with the whole paraphernalia of
sporting, were annihilated. Indeed, to do justice to his elegant
and highly-finished friend, these pictures were the production of a
master-hand, and might have made a dangerous impression on minds
more stoical and determined than that of Bob's. The opera, theatres,
fashionable pursuits, characters, objects, &amp;c. all became in succession
the subjects of his pen; and if lively description, blended with
irresistible humour and sarcastic wit, possessed any power of seduction,
these certainly belonged to Bob's honourable friend and relative, as an
epistolary correspondent. The following Stanzas were often recited by
him with great feeling and animation:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
     Parent of Pleasure and of many a groan,
     I should be loath to part with thee, I own,
     Dear Life!
     To tell the truth, I'd rather lose a <i>wife</i>,
     Should Heav'n e'er deem me worthy of possessing
     That best, that most invaluable blessing.
     I thank thee, that thou brought'st me into being;
     The things of this our world are well worth seeing;
     And let me add, moreover, well worth feeling;
     Then what the Devil would people have?
     These gloomy hunters of the grave,
     For ever sighing, groaning, canting, kneeling.
     Some wish they never had been born, how odd!
     To see the handy works of God,
     In sun and moon, and starry sky;
     Though last, not least, to see sweet Woman's charms,&mdash;
     Nay, more, to clasp them in our arms,
     And pour the soul in love's delicious sigh,
     Is well worth coming for, I'm sure,
     Supposing that thou gav'st us nothing more.
     Yet, thus surrounded, Life, dear Life, I'm thine,
     And, could I always call thee mine,
     I would not quickly bid this world farewell;
     But whether here, or long or short my stay,
     I'll keep in mind for ev'ry day
     An old French motto, "<i>Vive la bagatelle!</i>"
     Misfortunes are this lottery-world's sad blanks;
     Presents, in my opinion, not worth thanks.
     The pleasures are the twenty thousand prizes,
     Which nothing but a <i>downright ass</i> despises.
</pre>
<p>
It was not, however, the mere representations of Bob's friend, with
which, (in consequence of the important result,) we commenced our
chapter, that produced the powerful effect of fixing the wavering mind
of Bob&mdash;No, it was the air&mdash;the manner&mdash;the <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, by which
these representations were accompanied: the curled lip of contempt, and
the eye, measuring as he spoke, from top to toe, his companions, with
the cool elegant sang froid and self-possession displayed in his own
person and manner, which became a <i>fiat</i> with Bob, and which effected
the object so long courted by his cousin.
</p>
<p>
After the manner of Yorick (though, by the bye, no sentimentalist) Bob
thus reasoned with himself:&mdash;"If an acquaintance with London is to give
a man these airs of superiority&mdash;this ascendancy&mdash;elegance of manners,
and command of enjoyments&mdash;why, London for me; and if pleasure is the
game in view, there will I instantly pursue the sport."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>The song and toast, in unison with the sparkling glass, followed each
other in rapid succession. During which, our elegant London visitor
favoured the company with the following effusion, sung in a style equal
to (though unaccompanied with the affected airs and self-importance of)
a first-rate professor:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
     SONG.

     If to form and distinction, in town you would bow,
     Let appearance of wealth be your care:
     If your friends see you live, not a creature cares how,
     The question will only be, Where?
     A circus, a polygon, crescent, or place,
     With ideas of magnificence tally;
     Squares are common, streets queer, but a lane's a disgrace;
     And we've no such thing as an alley.
     A first floor's pretty well, and a parlour so so;
     But, pray, who can give themselves airs,
     Or mix with high folks, if so vulgarly low
     To live up in a two pair of stairs?
     The garret, excuse me, I mean attic floor,
     (That's the name, and it's right you should know it,)
     Would he tenantless often; but genius will soar,
     And it does very well for a poet.
</pre>
<p>
These amusements of the table were succeeded by a most stormy and
lengthened debate, (to use a parliamentary phrase) during which, Bob's
London friend had with daring heroism opposed the whole of the party,
in supporting the superiority of Life in London over every pleasure
the country could afford. After copious libations to Bacchus, whose
influence at length effected what oratory had in vain essayed, and
silenced these contending and jarring elements, "grey-eyed Morn" peeped
intrusively amid the jovial crew, and Somnus, (with the cart before the
horse) stepping softly on tip-toe after his companion, led, if not by,
at least accompanied with, the music of the nose, each to his snoring
pillow.<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
</p>
<p>
&mdash;&mdash;"Glorious resolve!" exclaimed Tom, as soon as his friend had next
morning intimated his intention,&mdash;"nobly resolved indeed!&mdash;"What! shall
he whom Nature has formed to shine in the dance and sparkle in the
ring&mdash;to fascinate the fair&mdash;lead and control the fashions&mdash;attract the
gaze and admiration of the surrounding crowd!&mdash;shall he pass a life, or
rather a torpid existence, amid country bumpkins and Johnny-raws? Forbid
it all ye powers that rule with despotic sway where Life alone is to
be found,&mdash;forbid it cards&mdash;dice&mdash;balls&mdash;fashion, and ye gay et
coteras,&mdash;forbid"&mdash;&mdash;"Pon my soul," interrupted Bob, "you have
frightened me to death! I thought you were beginning an Epic,&mdash;a thing
I abominate of all others. I had rather at any time follow the pack on
a foundered horse than read ten lines of Homer; so, my dear fellow,
descend for God's sake from the Heroics."
</p>
<pre>
          Calmly let me, at least, begin Life's chapter,
          Not panting for a hurricane of rapture;
          Calm let me step&mdash;not riotous and jumping:
          With due decorum, let my heart
          Try to perform a sober part,
          Not at the ribs be ever bumping&mdash;bumping.
          Rapture's a charger&mdash;often breaks his girt,
          Runs oft", and flings his rider in the dirt.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>"However, it shall be so: adieu, my dear little roan
filly,&mdash;Snow-ball, good by,&mdash;my new patent double-barrelled
percussion&mdash;ah, I give you all up!&mdash;Order the tandem, my dear Tom,
whenever you please; whisk me up to the fairy scenes you have so often
and admirably described; and, above all things, take me as an humble and
docile pupil under your august auspices and tuition." Says Tom, "thou
reasonest well."
</p>
<p>
The rapidity with which great characters execute their determinations
has been often remarked by authors. The dashing tandem, with its
beautiful high-bred bits of blood, accompanied by two grooms on
horsebaek in splendid liveries, stood at the lodge-gate, and our heroes
had only to bid adieu to relatives and friends, and commence their rapid
career.
</p>
<p>
Before we start on this long journey of one hundred and eighty miles,
with the celerity which is unavoidable in modern travelling, it may be
prudent to ascertain that our readers are still in company, and that we
all start fairly together; otherwise, there is but little probability
of our ever meeting again on the journey;&mdash;so now to satisfy queries,
remarks, and animadversions.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Sir, I must say it is a new way of introducing a story, and
appears to me very irregular.&mdash;What! tumble your hero neck and heels
into the midst of a drunken fox-hunting party, and then carry him
off from his paternal estate, without even noticing his ancestors,
relatives, friends, connexions, or prospects&mdash;without any description
of romantic scenery on the estate&mdash;without so much as an allusion to the
female who first kindled in his breast the tender passion, or a detail
of those incidents with which it is usually connected!&mdash;a strange, very
strange way indeed this of commencing."
</p>
<p>
"My dear Sir, I agree with you as to the deviation from customary rules:
but allow me to ask,&mdash;is not one common object&mdash;amusement, all we have
in view? Suppose then, by way of illustration, you were desirous of
arriving at a given place or object, to which there were several roads,
and having traversed one of these till the monotony of the scene had
rendered every object upon it dull and wearisome, would you quarrel with
the traveller who pointed out another road, merely because it was a new
one? Considering the impatience of our young friends, the one to return
to scenes in which alone he can <span class="pagenum">[6]</span>live, and the other to realize
ideal dreams of happiness, painted in all the glowing tints that a
warm imagination and youthful fancy can pourtray, it will be impossible
longer to continue the argument. Let me, therefore, entreat you to cut
it short&mdash;accompany us in our rapid pursuit after Life in London; nor
risk for the sake of a little peevish criticism, the cruel reflection,
that by a refusal, you would, probably, be in <i>at the death</i> of the
Author&mdash;by Starvation."

<h2>
    CHAPTER II
</h2>
<pre>
     "The panting steed the hero's empire feel,
     Who sits triumphant o'er the flying wheel,
     And as he guides it through th' admiring throng,
     With what an air he holds the reins, and smacks the silken thong!"
</pre>
<p>
ORDINARY minds, in viewing distant objects, first see the obstacles that
intervene, magnify the difficulty of surmounting them, and sit down in
despair. The man of genius with his mind's-eye pointed steadfastly, like
the needle towards the pole, on the object of his ambition, meets and
conquers every difficulty in detail, and the mass dissolves before
him as the mountain snow yields, drop by drop, to the progressive but
invincible operation of the solar beam. Our honourable friend was well
aware that a perfect knowledge of the art of driving, and the character
of a "<i>first-rate whip</i>," were objects worthy his ambition; and that,
to hold four-in-hand&mdash;turn a corner in style&mdash;handle the reins in
form&mdash;take a fly off the tip of his leader's ear&mdash;square the elbows, and
keep the wrists pliant, were matters as essential to the formation of a
man of fashion as <i>dice or milling</i>: it was a principle he had long laid
down and strictly adhered to, that whatever tended to the completion
of that character, should be acquired to the very acmé of perfection,
without regard to ulterior consequences, or minor pursuits.
</p>
<p>
In an early stage, therefore, of his fashionable course of studies,
the whip became an object of careful solicitude; and after some private
tuition, he first exhibited his prowess about twice a week, on the
box of a Windsor stage, tipping coachy a crown for the indulgence and
improvement it afforded. Few could boast of being more fortunate
during a noviciate: two overturns only occurred in the whole course of
practice, and except the trifling accident of an old lady being killed,
a shoulder or two dislocated, and about half a dozen legs and arms
<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>broken, belonging to people who were not at all known in high
life, nothing worthy of notice may be said to have happened on these
occasions. 'Tis true, some ill-natured remarks appeared in one of the
public papers, on the "conduct of coachmen entrusting the reins to
young practitioners, and thus endangering the lives of his majesty's
subjects;" but these passed off like other philanthropic suggestions of
the day, unheeded and forgotten.
</p>
<p>
The next advance of our hero was an important step. The mail-coach is
considered the school; its driver, the great master of the art&mdash;the
<i>Phidias</i> of the statuary&mdash;the <i>Claude</i> of the landscape-painter. To
approach him without preparatory instruction and study, would be like
an attempt to copy the former without a knowledge of anatomy, or the
latter, while ignorant of perspective. The standard of excellence&mdash;the
model of perfection, all that the highest ambition can attain, is to
approach as near as possible the original; to attempt a deviation, would
be to <i>bolt out of the course, snap the curb, and run riot</i>. Sensible
of the importance of his character, accustomed to hold the reins of
arbitrary power; and seated where will is law, the mail-whip carries
in his appearance all that may be expected from his elevated situation.
Stern and sedate in his manner, and given to taciturnity, he speaks
sententiously, or in monosyllables. If he passes on the road even an
humble follower of the profession, with four tidy ones in hand, he
views him with ineffable contempt, and would consider it an irreparable
disgrace to appear conscious of the proximity. Should it be a country
gentleman of large property and influence, and he held the reins,
and handled the whip with a knowledge of the art, so to "get over the
ground," coachy might, perhaps, notice him "<i>en passant</i>," by a slight
and familiar nod; but it is only the peer, or man of first-rate sporting
celebrity, that is honoured with any thing like a familiar mark of
approbation and acquaintance; and these, justly appreciating the proud
distinction, feel higher gratification by it than any thing the monarch
could bestow: it is an inclination of the head, not forward, in the
manner of a nod, but towards the off shoulder, accompanied with a
certain jerk and elevation from the opposite side. But here neither pen
nor pencil can depict; it belongs to him alone whose individual powers
can nightly keep the house <span class="pagenum">[9]</span>in a roar, to catch the living manner and
present it to the eye.
</p>
<pre>
          "&mdash;&mdash;A merrier man

          Within the limit of becoming mirth,
          I never spent an hour's talk withall:
          His eye begets occasion for his wit;
          For every object that the one doth catch
          The other turns to a mirth-moving jest."
</pre>
<p>
And now, gentle reader, if the epithet means any thing, you cannot but
feel disposed to good humour and indulgence: Instead of rattling you
off, as was proposed at our last interview, and whirling you at the
rate of twelve miles an hour, exhausted with fatigue, and half <i>dead</i>
in pursuit of <i>Life</i>, we have proceeded gently along the road, amusing
ourselves by the way, rather with drawing than driving. 'Tis high time,
however, we made some little progress in our journey: "Come Bob,
take the reins&mdash;push on&mdash;keep moving&mdash;touch up the leader into a
hand-gallop&mdash;give Snarler his head&mdash;that's it my tight one, keep out of
the ruts&mdash;mind your quartering&mdash;not a gig, buggy, tandem, or tilbury,
have we yet seen on the road&mdash;what an infernal place for a human
being to inhabit!&mdash;curse me if I had not as lief emigrate to the back
settlements of America: one might find some novelty and amusement
there&mdash;I'd have the woods cleared&mdash;cut out some turnpike-roads, and,
like Palmer, start the first mail"&mdash;&mdash;"Stop, Tom, don't set off yet
to the Illinois&mdash;here's something ahead, but what the devil it is I
cant guess&mdash;why it's a barge on wheels, and drove four-in-hand."&mdash;"Ha,
ha&mdash;barge indeed, Bob, you seem to know as much about coaches as Snarler
does of Back-gammon: I suppose you never see any thing in this quarter
but the old heavy Bridgewater&mdash;why we have half a dozen new launches
every week, and as great a variety of names, shape, size, and colour,
as there are ships in the navy&mdash;we have the heavy coach, light coach,
Caterpillar, and Mail&mdash;the Balloon, Comet, Fly, Dart, Regulator,
Telegraph, Courier, Times, High-flyer, Hope, with as many others as
would fill a list as long as my tandem-whip. What you now see is one of
the <i>new patent safety-coaches</i>&mdash;you can't have an overturn if you're
ever so disposed for a spree. The old city cormorants, after a gorge of
mock-turtle, turn into them for a journey, and drop off in a <span class="pagenum">[10]</span>nap,
with as much confidence of security to their neck and limbs as if they
had mounted a rocking-horse, or drop't into an arm-chair."&mdash;"Ah! come,
the scene improves, and becomes a little like Life&mdash;here's a dasher
making up to the Safety&mdash;why its&mdash;no, impossible&mdash;can't be&mdash;gad it
is tho'&mdash;the Dart, by all that's good! and drove by Hell-fire
Dick!&mdash;there's a fellow would do honour to any box&mdash;drove the Cambridge
Fly three months&mdash;pass'd every thing on the road, and because he
overturned in three or four hard matches, the stupid rascals of
proprietors moved him off the ground. Joe Spinum, who's at Corpus
Christi, matched Dick once for 50, when he carried five inside
and thirteen at top, besides heavy luggage, against the other
Cambridge&mdash;never was a prettier race seen at Newmarket&mdash;Dick must
have beat hollow, but a d&mdash;&mdash;d fat alderman who was inside, and felt
alarmed at the velocity of the vehicle, moved to the other end of the
seat: this destroyed the equilibrium&mdash;over they went, into a four-feet
ditch, and Joe lost his match. However, he had the satisfaction of
hearing afterwards, that the old cormorant who occasioned his loss, had
nearly burst himself by the concussion."
</p>
<p>
"See, see!&mdash;Dick's got up to, and wants to give the Safety the go
by&mdash;gad, its a race&mdash;go it Dick&mdash;now Safety&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;d good cattle
both&mdash;lay it in to 'em Dick&mdash;leaders neck and neck&mdash;pretty race
by G&mdash;&mdash;! Ah, its of no use Safety&mdash;Dick wont stand it&mdash;a dead
beat&mdash;there she goes&mdash;all up&mdash;over by Jove "&mdash;&mdash;"I can't see for that
tree&mdash;what do you say Tom, is the race over?"&mdash;"Race, ah! and the coach
too&mdash;knew Dick would beat him&mdash;would have betted the long odds the
moment I saw it was him."
</p>
<p>
The tandem had by this time reached the race-course, and the disaster
which Tom had hardly thought worth noticing in his lively description of
the sport, sure enough had befallen the <i>new 'patent Safety</i>, which was
about mid way between an upright and a side position, supported by the
high and very strong quicksett-hedge against which it hath fallen. Our
heroes dismounted, left Flip at the leader's head, and with Ned, the
other groom, proceeded to offer their services. Whilst engaged in
extricating the horses, which had become entangled in their harness, and
were kicking and plunging, their attention was arrested by the screams
and outrageous vociferations of a very fat, middle-aged woman, who
had <span class="pagenum">[11]</span>been jerked from her seat on the box to one not quite so
smooth&mdash;the top of the hedge, which, with the assistance of an old alder
tree, supported the coach. Tom found it impossible to resist the violent
impulse to risibility which the ludicrous appearance of the old lady
excited, and as no serious injury was sustained, determined to enjoy the
fun.
</p>
<pre>
          "If e'er a pleasant mischief sprang to view,
          At once o'er hedge and ditch away he flew,
          Nor left the game till he had run it down."
</pre>
<p>
Approaching her with all the gravity of countenance he was master
of&mdash;"Madam," says he, "are we to consider you as one of the Sylvan
Deities who preside over these scenes, or connected in any way with the
vehicle?"&mdash;"Wehicle, indeed, you <i>hunhuman-brutes</i>, instead of assisting
a poor distressed female who has been chuck'd from top of that there
<i>safety-thing</i>, as they calls it, into such a dangerous <i>pisition</i>, you
must be chuckling and grinning, must you? I only wish my husband, Mr.
Giblet, was here, he should soon wring your necks, and pluck some of
your fine feathers for you, and make you look as foolish as a peacock
without his tail." Mrs. Giblet's ire at length having subsided, she was
handed down in safety on <i>terra firma</i>, and our heroes transferred their
assistance to the other passengers. The violence of the concussion had
burst open the coach-door on one side, and a London <i>Dandy</i>, of the
exquisite genus, lay in danger of being pressed to a jelly beneath the
weight of an infirm and very stout old farmer, whom they had pick'd up
on the road; and it was impossible to get at, so as to afford relief to
the sufferers, till the coach was raised in a perpendicular position.
The farmer was no sooner on his legs, than clapping his hand with
anxious concern into an immense large pocket, he discovered that a
bottle of brandy it contained was crack'd, and the contents beginning to
escape: "I ax pardon, young gentleman," says he, seizing a hat that the
latter held with great care in his hand, and applying it to catch the
liquor&mdash;"I ax pardon for making so free, but I see the hat is a little
out of order, and can't be much hurt; and its a pity to waste the
liquor, such a price as it is now-a-days."&mdash;"Sir, what do you mean,
shouldn't have thought of your taking such liberties indeed, but makes
good the old saying&mdash;impudence and <span class="pagenum">[12]</span>ignorance go together: my hat
out of order, hey! I'd have you to know, Sir, that <i>that there</i> hat
was bought of Lloyd, in Newgate-street,{1} only last Thursday,-and cost
eighteen shillings; and if you look at the book in his <i>vindow</i> on
hats, dedicated to the head, you'll find that this here hat is a real
exquisite; so much for what you know about hats, my old fellow&mdash;I burst
my stays all to pieces in saving it from being squeezed out of shape,
and now this old brute has made a brandy-bottle of it."&mdash;"Oh! oh! my
young Miss in disguise," replied the farmer, "I thought I smelt a
rat when the Captain left the coach, under pretence of walking up the
hill&mdash;what, I suppose vou are bound for Gretna, both of vou, hev young
Lady?"
</p>
<p>
Every thing appertaining to the coach being now righted, our young
friends left the company to adjust their quarrels and pursue their
journey at discretion, anxious to reach the next town as expeditiously
as possible, where they purposed sleeping for the night. They mounted
the tandem, smack went the whip, and in a few minutes the stage-coach
and its motley group had disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Having reached their destination, and passed the night comfortably, they
next morning determined to kill an hour or two in the town; and were
taking a stroll arm in arm, when perceiving by a playbill, that an
amateur of fashion from the theatres royal, Drury Lane and Haymarket,
was just <i>come in</i>, and would shortly <i>come out</i>,
</p>
<pre>
     1 It would be injustice to great talents, not to notice,
     among other important discoveries and improvements of the
     age, the labours of Lloyd, who has classified and arranged
     whatever relates to that necessary article of personal
     elegance, the Hat. He has given the world a volume on the
     subject of Hats, dedicated to their great patron, the Head,
     in which all the endless varieties of shape, dependent
     before on mere whim and caprice, are reduced to fixed
     principles, and designated after the great characters by
     which each particular fashion was first introduced. The
     advantages to gentlemen residing in the country must be
     incalculable: they have only to refer to the engravings in
     Mr. Lloyd's work, where every possible variety is clearly
     defined, and to order such as may suit the rank or character

</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>in a favourite character, they immediately directed their steps
towards a barn, with the hope of witnessing a rehearsal. Chance
introduced them to the country manager, and Tom having asked several
questions about this candidate, was assured by Mr. Mist:
</p>
<p>
"Oh! he is a gentleman-performer, and very useful to us managers, for he
not only finds his own dresses and properties, but 'struts and frets
his hour on the stage without any emoluments. His aversion to salary
recommended him to the lessee of Drury-lane theatre, though his services
had been previously rejected by the sub-committee."
</p>
<p>
"Can it be that game-cock, the gay Lothario," said Tom, "who sports an
immensity of diamonds?"&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Of Coates's frolics he of course well knew, Rare pastime for the
ragamuffin crew! Who welcome with the crowing of a cock, This hero of
the buskin and sock.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! no," rejoined Mr. Mist, "that cock don't crow now: this gentleman,
I assure you, has been at a theatrical school; he was instructed by the
person who made Master Bettv a young Roscius."
</p>
<p>
Tom shook his head, as if he doubted the abilities of this instructed
actor. To be a performer, he thought as arduous as to be a poet; and
if <i>poeta nascitur, non fit</i>&mdash;consequently an actor must have natural
abilities.
</p>
<p>
"And pray what character did this gentleman enact at Drury-lane
Theatre?"
</p>
<p>
"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," answered Mr. Mist&mdash;"Shakespeare is his
favourite author."
</p>
<p>
"And what said the critics&mdash;'to be, or not to be'&mdash;I suppose he repeated
the character?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! Sir, it was stated in the play-bill, that he met with great
applause, and he was announced for the character again; but, as the Free
List was not suspended, and our amateur dreaded some hostility from that
quarter, he performed the character by proxy, and repeated it at the
Little Theatre in the Haymarket."
</p>
<p>
"Then the gentlemen of the Free List," remarked Bob, "are free and
easy?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;they laugh and cough whenever they please: indeed, they are
generally excluded whenever a <span class="pagenum">[14]</span>full house is expected, as <i>ready
money</i> is an object to the poor manager of Drury-lane Theatre. The
British Press, however, is always excepted."
</p>
<p>
"The British press!&mdash;Oh! you mean the newspapers," exclaimed Tom&mdash;"then
I dare say they were very favourable to this Amateur of Fashion?"
</p>
<p>
"No&mdash;not very&mdash;indeed; they don't join the manager in his puffs,
notwithstanding his marked civility to them: one said he was a methodist
preacher, and sermonized the character&mdash;another assimilated him to a
school-boy saying his lesson&mdash;in short, they were very ill-natured&mdash;but
hush&mdash;here he is&mdash;walk in, gentlemen, and you shall hear him rehearse
some of King Richard"&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"King Richard!" What ambition! thought Bob to himself&mdash;"late a Prince,
and now&mdash;a king!"
</p>
<p>
"I assure you," continued Mr. Mist, "that all his readings are new; but
according to my humble observation, his action does not always suit the
word&mdash;for when he exclaims&mdash;' may Hell make crook'd my mind,' he looks
up to Heaven"&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Looks up to Heaven!" exclaimed Tom; "then this London star makes a
solecism with his eyes."
</p>
<p>
Our heroes now went into the barn, and took a private corner, when they
remained invisible. Their patience was soon exhausted, and Bob and his
honourable cousin were both on the fidgits, when the representative of
King Richard exclaimed&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Give me a horse&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"&mdash;Whip!" added Tom with stunning vociferation, before King Richard
could bind up his wounds. The amateur started, and betrayed consummate
embarrassment, as if the horsewhip had actually made its entrance. Tom
and his companion stole away, and left the astounded monarch with the
words&mdash;"twas all a dream."
</p>
<pre>
While returning to the inn, our heroes mutually commented on the
ambition and folly of those amateurs of fashion, who not only sacrifice
time and property, but absolutely take abundant pains to render
themselves ridiculous. "Certainly," says Tom, "this <i>cacoethes ludendi</i>
has made fools of several: this infatuated youth though not possessed
of a single requisite for the stage, no doubt flatters himself he is
a second Kean; and, regardless <span class="pagenum">[15]</span>of his birth and family, he will
continue his strolling life
     
     Till the broad shame comes staring in his face,
     And critics hoot the blockhead as he struts."
</pre>
<p>
Having now reached the inn, and finding every thing adjusted for their
procedure, our heroes mounted their vehicle, and went in full gallop for
Real Life in London.

    CHAPTER III
</h2>
<pre>
          "Round, round, and round-about, they whiz, they fly,
          With eager worrying, whirling here and there,
          They know, nor whence, nor whither, where, nor why.
          In utter hurry-scurry, going, coming,
          Maddening the summer air with ceaseless humming."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>OUR travellers now approached at a rapid rate, the desideratim
of their eager hopes and wishes: to one all was novel, wonderful, and
fascinating; to the other, it was the welcome return to an old and
beloved friend, the separation from whom had but increased the ardour
of attachment.&mdash;"We, now," says Dashall, "are approaching Hyde-Park,
and being Sunday, a scene will at once burst upon you, far surpassing
in reality any thing I have been able to pourtray, notwithstanding
the flattering compliments you have so often paid to my talents for
description."
</p>

<p>
They had scarcely entered the Park-gate, when Lady Jane Townley's
carriage crossed them, and Tom immediately approached it, to pay his
respects to an old acquaintance. Her lady-ship congratulated him on his
return to town, lamented the serious loss the <i>beau-monde</i> had sustained
by his absence, and smiling archly at his young friend, was happy
to find he had not returned empty-handed, but with a recruit, whose
appearance promised a valuable accession to their select circle. "You
would not have seen me here," continued her ladyship, "but I vow and
protest it is utterly impossible to make a prisoner of one's self, such
a day as this, merely because it is Sunday&mdash;for my own part, I wish
there was no such thing as a Sunday in the whole year&mdash;there's no
knowing what to do with one's self. When fine, it draws out as many
insects as a hot sun and a shower of rain can produce in the middle of
June. The vulgar plebeians flock so, that you can scarcely get into your
barouche without being hustled by the men-milliners, linen-drapers, and
shop-boys, who <span class="pagenum">[17]</span>have been serving you all the previous part of
the week; and wet, or dry, there's no bearing it. For my part, I am
<i>ennuyée</i>, beyond measure, on that day, and find no little difficulty in
getting through it without a fit of the horrors.
</p>
<p>
"What a legion of counter-coxcombs!" exclaimed she, as we passed
Grosvenor-gate. "Upon the plunder of the till, or by overcharging
some particular article sold on the previous day, it is easy for these
<i>once-a-week</i> beaux to hire a tilbury, and an awkward groom in a pepper
and salt, or drab coat, like the <i>incog.</i> of the royal family, to mix
with their betters and sport their persons in the drive of fashion: some
of the monsters, too, have the impudence of bowing to ladies whom they
do not know, merely to give them an air, or pass off their customers for
their acquaintance: its very distressing. There!" continued she, "there
goes my plumassier, with gilt spurs like a field-officer, and riding
as importantly as if he were one of the Lords of the Treasury; or&mdash;ah!
there, again, is my banker's clerk, so stiff and so laced up, that he
might pass for an Egyptian mummy&mdash;the self-importance of these puppies
is insufferable! What impudence! he has picked up some groom out of
place, with a cockade in his hat, by way of imposing on the world for a
<i>beau militaire</i>. What will the world come to! I really have not common
patience with these creatures. I have long since left off going to the
play on a Saturday night, because, independently of my preference for
the Opera, these insects from Cornhill or Whitechapel, shut up their
shops, cheat their masters, and commence their airs of importance about
nine o'clock. Then again you have the same party crowding the Park on
a Sunday; but on the following day, return, like school boys, to their
work, and you see them with their pen behind their ear, calculating how
to make up for their late extravagances, pestering you with lies, and
urging you to buy twice as much as you want, then officiously offering
their arm at your carriage-door."
</p>
<p>
Capt. Bergamotte at this moment came up to the carriage, perfumed like a
milliner, his colour much heightened by some vegetable dye, and resolved
neither to "blush unseen," nor "waste his sweetness on the desert air."
Two false teeth in front, shamed the others a little in their ivory
polish, and his breath savoured of myrrh like a heathen sacrifice, or
the incense burned in <span class="pagenum">[18]</span>one of their temples. He thrust his horse's
head into the carriage, rather abruptly and indecorously, (as one not
accustomed to the haut-ton might suppose) but it gave no offence. He
smiled affectedly, adjusted his hat, pulled a lock of hair across his
forehead, with a view of shewing the whiteness of the latter, and next,
that the glossiness of the former must have owed its lustre to at least
two hours brushing, arranging, and perfuming; used his quizzing-glass,
and took snuff with a flourish. Lady Townley condescended to caress the
horse, and to display her lovely white arm ungloved, with which she
patted the horse's neck, and drew a hundred admiring eyes.
</p>
<p>
The exquisite all this time brushed the animal gently with a
highly-scented silk handkerchief, after which he displayed a cambric
one, and went through a thousand little playful airs and affectations,
which Bob thought would have suited a fine lady better than a lieutenant
in his Majesty's brigade of guards. Applying the lines of an inimitable
satire, (The Age of Frivolity) to the figure before him, he concluded:
</p>
<pre>
          "That gaudy dress and decorations gay,
          The tinsel-trappings of a vain array.
          The spruce trimm'd jacket, and the waving plume,
          The powder'd head emitting soft perfume;
          These may make fops, but never can impart
          The soldier's hardy frame, or daring heart;
          May in Hyde-Park present a splendid train,
          But are not weapons for a dread campaign;
          May please the fair, who like a tawdry beau,
          But are not fit to check an active foe;
          Such heroes may acquire sufficient skill
          To march erect, and labour through a drill;
          In some sham-fight may manfully hold out,
          But must not hope an enemy to rout."
</pre>
<p>
Although he talked a great deal, the whole amount of his discourse was
to inform her Ladyship that (<i>Stilletto</i>) meaning his horse, (who in
truth appeared to possess more fire and spirit than his rider could
either boast of or command,) had cost him only 700 guineas, and was
<i>prime blood</i>; that the horse his groom rode, was <i>nothing but a
</i>good one<i>, and had run at the </i>Craven&mdash;that he had been prodigiously
fortunate that season on the turf&mdash;that he was a bold rider, and could
not bear himself without a fine high spirited animal&mdash;and, that being
engaged to dine at <span class="pagenum">[19]</span>three places that day, he was desperately at a
loss to know how he should act; but that if her Ladyship dined at any
one of the three, he would certainly join that party, and <i>cut</i> the
other two.
</p>
<p>
At this moment, a mad-brained ruffian of quality, with a splendid
equipage, came driving by with four in hand, and exclaimed as he flew
past, in an affected tone,&mdash;"All! Tom, my dear fellow,&mdash;why where the
devil have you hid yourself of late?" The speed of his cattle prevented
the possibility of reply. "Although you see him in such excellent trim,"
observed Tom to Lady Jane, "though his cattle and equipage are so well
appointed, would you suppose, it, he has but just made his appearance
from the Bench after <i>white-washing?</i> But he is a noble spirited
fellow," remarked the exquisite, "drives the best horses, and is one of
the first whips in town; always gallant and gay, full of life and good
humour; and, I am happy to say, he has now a dozen of as fine horses
as any in Christendom, <i>bien entendu</i>, kept in my name." After this
explanation of the characters of his friend and his horses, he kissed
his hand to her Ladyship, and was out of sight in an instant, "Adieu,
adieu, thou dear, delightful sprig of fashion!" said Lady Jane, as he
left the side of the carriage.&mdash;"Fashion and folly," said Tom, half
whispering, and recalling to his mind the following lines:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Oh! Fashion, to thy wiles, thy votaries owe
          Unnumber'd pangs of sharp domestic woe.
          What broken tradesmen and abandon'd wives
          Curse thy delusion through their wretched lives;
          What pale-faced spinsters vent on thee their rage,
          And youths decrepid e're they come of age."
</pre>
<p>
His moralizing reverie was however interrupted by her Ladyship,
who perceiving a group of females decked in the extreme of Parisian
fashions, "there," said she, "there is all that taffeta, feathers,
flowers, and lace can do; and yet you see by their loud talking, their
being unattended by a servant, and by the bit of straw adhering to the
pettycoat of one of them, that they come all the way from Fish Street
Hill, or the Borough, in a hackney-coach, and are now trying to play off
the airs of women of fashion."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Marvellous now drew up close to the party. "My dear Lady Jane,"
said she, "1 am positively suffocated with dust, and sickened with
vulgarity; but to be sure we <span class="pagenum">[20]</span>have every thing in London here, from
the House of Peers to Waterloo House. I must tell you about the
trial, and Lady Barbara's mortification, and about poor Mr. R.'s being
arrested, and the midnight flight to the Continent of our poor friend
W&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>
<p>
With this brief, but at the same time comprehensive introduction, she
lacerated the reputation of almost all her acquaintance, and excited
great attention from the party, which had been joined by several during
her truly interesting intelligence. Every other topic in a moment gave
way to this delightful amusement, and each with volubility contributed
his or her share to the general stock of slander.
</p>
<p>
Scandal is at all times the <i>sauce piquante</i> that <i>currys</i> incident in
every situation; and where is the fashionable circle that can sit down
to table without made dishes?&mdash;Character is the good old-fashioned roast
beef of the table, which no one touches but to mangle and destroy.
</p>
<pre>
          "Lord! who'd have thought our cousin D
          Could think of marrying Mrs. E.
          True I don't like such things to tell;
          But, faith, I pity Mrs. L,
          And was I her, the bride to vex,
          I would engage with Mrs. X.
          But they do say that Charlotte U,
          With Fanny M, and we know who,
          Occasioned all, for you must know
          They set their caps at Mr. O.
          And as he courted Mrs. E,
          They thought, if she'd have cousin D,
          That things might be by Colonel A
          Just brought about in their own way."
</pre>
<p>
Our heroes now took leave, and proceeded through the Park. "Who is that
fat, fair, and forty-looking dame, in the landau?" says Bob.&mdash;"Your
description shews," rejoined his friend, "you are but a novice in the
world of fashion&mdash;you are deceived, that lady is as much made up as a
wax-doll. She has been such as she now appears to be for these last
five and twenty years; her figure as you see, rather en-bon point, is
friendly to the ravages of time, and every lineament of age is artfully
filled up by an expert fille de chambre, whose time has been employed
at the toilette of a celebrated devotee in Paris. She drives through the
Park as a matter of course, merely to furnish an opportunity for saying
that she has been there: but the more important business of the morning
will be transacted <span class="pagenum">[21]</span>at her boudoir, in the King's Road, where
every luxury is provided to influence the senses; and where, by daily
appointment, she is expected to meet a sturdy gallant. She is a perfect
Messalina in her enjoyments; but her rank in society protects her from
sustaining any injury by her sentimental wanderings.
</p>
<p>
"Do you see that tall handsome man on horseback, who has just taken
off his hat to her, he is a knight of the ... ribbon; and a well-known
flutterer among the ladies, as well as a vast composer of pretty little
nothings."&mdash;"Indeed! and pray, cousin, do you see that lady of quality,
just driving in at the gate in a superb yellow vis-à-vis,&mdash;as you seem
to know every body, who is she?"
</p>
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" replied Tom, almost bursting with laughter, yet
endeavouring to conceal it, "that Lady of Quality, as you are inclined
to think her, a very few years since, was nothing more than a pot-girl
to a publican in Marj'-le-bone; but an old debauchee (upon the look
out for defenceless beauty) admiring the fineness of her form, the
brilliancy of her eye, and the symmetry of her features, became the
possessor of her person, and took her into keeping, as one of the
indispensable appendages of fashionable life, after a month's ablution
at Margate, where he gave her masters of every description. Her
understanding was ready, and at his death, which happened, luckily for
her, before satiety had extinguished appetite, she was left with
an annuity of twelve hundred pounds&mdash;improved beauty&mdash;superficial
accomplishments&mdash;and an immoderate share of caprice, insolence,
and vanity. As a proof of this, I must tell you that at an elegant
entertainment lately given by this dashing cyprian, she demolished a
desert service of glass and china that cost five hundred guineas, in a
fit of passionate ill-humour; and when her paramour intreated her to be
more composed, she became indignant&mdash;called for her writing-desk in a
rage&mdash;committed a settlement of four hundred a year, which he had made
but a short time previously, to the flames, and asked him, with, a
self-important air, whether he dared to suppose that <i>paltry</i> parchment
gave him an authority to direct her actions?"
</p>
<p>
"And what said the lover to this severe remonstrance?"
</p>
<p>
"Say,&mdash;why he very sensibly made her a low bow, thanked her for her
kindness, in releasing him from his bond, and took his leave of her,
determined to return no more."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>"Turn to the right," says Tom, "and yonder you will see on
horseback, that staunch patriot, and friend of the people, Sir&mdash;&mdash;, of
whom you must have heard so much."
</p>
<p>
"He has just come out of the K&mdash;&mdash;B&mdash;&mdash;, having completed last week
the term of imprisonment, to which he was sentenced for a libel on
Government, contained in his address to his constituents on the subject
of the memorable Manchester Meeting."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! indeed, and is that the red-hot patriot?&mdash;well, I must say I have
often regretted he should have gone to such extremes in one or two
instances, although I ever admired his general character for firmness,
manly intrepidity, and disinterested conduct."
</p>
<p>
"You are right, Bob, perfectly right; but you know, 'to err is human, to
forgive divine,' and however he may err, he does so from principle.
In his private character, as father, husband, friend, and polished
gentleman, he has very few equals&mdash;no superior.
</p>
<p>
"He is a branch of one of the most ancient families in the kingdom, and
can trace his ancestors without interruption, from the days of William
the Conqueror. His political career has been eventful, and perhaps has
cost him more, both in pocket and person, than any Member of Parliament
now existing. He took his seat in the House of Commons at an early age,
and first rendered himself popular by his strenuous opposition to a bill
purporting to regulate the publication of newspapers.
</p>
<p>
"The next object of his determined reprehension, was the
Cold-Bath-Fields Prison, and the treatment of the unfortunates therein
confined. The uniformly bold and energetic language made use of by
the honourable Baronet upon that occasion, breathed the true spirit of
British liberty. He reprobated the unconstitutional measure of erecting
what he termed a <i>Bastile</i> in the very heart of a free country, as
one that could neither have its foundation in national policy, nor
eventually be productive of private good. He remarked that prisons, at
which private punishments, cruel as they were illegal, were exercised,
at the mercy of an unprincipled gaoler&mdash;cells in which human beings were
exposed to the horrors of heart-sickening solitude, and depressed in
spirit by their restriction to a scanty and exclusive allowance of
bread and water, were not only incompatible with the spirit of the
constitution, but were likely to prove injurious to the spirit of the
<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>people of this happy country; for as Goldsmith admirably remarks,
</p>
<pre>
          "Princes and Lords may nourish or may fade,
          A breath can make them as a breath hath made,
          But a bold peasantry their country's pride,
          When once destroyed can never be supplied."
</pre>
<p>
"<i>And if this be not tyranny</i>" continued the philanthropic orator,
"<i>it is impossible to define the term. I promise you here</i> that I will
persevere to the last in unmasking this wanton abuse of justice and
humanity." His invincible fortitude in favour of the people, has
rendered him a distinguished favourite among them: and though by some he
is termed a visionary, an enthusiast, and a tool of party, his adherence
to the rights of the subject, and his perseverance to uphold the
principles of the constitution, are deserving the admiration of every
Englishman; and although his fortune is princely, and has been at his
command ever since an early age, he has never had his name registered
among the fashionable gamesters at the clubs in St. James's-street,
Newmarket, or elsewhere. He labours in the vineyard of utility rather
than in the more luxuriant garden of folly; and, according to general
conception, may emphatically be called an honest man. "But come," said
Tom, "it is time for us to move homeward&mdash;the company are drawing off I
see, we must shape our course towards Piccadilly."
</p>
<p>
They dashed through the Park, not however without being saluted by many
of his fashionable friends, who rejoiced to see that the Honourable
Tom Dashall was again to be numbered among the votaries of Real Life in
London; while the young squire, whose visionary orbs appeared to be
in perpetual motion, dazzled with the splendid equipages of the moving
panorama, was absorbed in reflections somewhat similar to the following:
</p>
<pre>
          "No spot on earth to me is half so fair
          As Hyde-Park Corner, or St. James's Square;
          And Happiness has surely fix'd her seat
          In Palace Yard, Pall Mall, or Downing Street:
          Are hills, and dales, and valleys half so gay
          As bright St. James's on a levee day?
          What fierce ecstatic transports fire my soul,
          To hear the drivers swear, the coaches roll;
          The Courtier's compliment, the Ladies' clack,
          The satins rustle, and the whalebone crack!"

<pre>
          "Together let us beat this ample field
          Try what the open, what the covert yield:
          The latent tracts, the giddy heights explore
          Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;
          Eye nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,
          And catch the manners living as they rise."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>IT was half past five when the Hon. Tom Dashall, and his enraptured
cousin, reached the habitation of the former, who had taken care to
dispatch a groom, apprizing Mrs. Watson, the house-keeper, of his
intention to be at home by half past six to dinner; consequently all
was prepared for their reception. The style of elegance in which Tom
appeared to move, struck Tallyho at once with delight and astonishment,
as they entered the drawing-room; which was superbly and tastefully
fitted up, and commanded a cheerful view of Piccadilly. "Welcome, my
dear Bob!" said Tom to his cousin, "to all the delights of Town&mdash;come,
tell me what you think of its first appearance, only remember you
commence your studies of Life in London on a dull day; to-morrow you
will have more enlivening prospects before you." "'Why in truth,"
replied Bob, "the rapidity of attraction is such, as at present to leave
no distinct impressions on my mind; all appears like enchantment, and
I am completely bewildered in a labyrinth of wonders, to which there
appears to be no end; but under your kind guidance and tuition I may
prove myself an apt scholar, in unravelling its intricacies." By this
time they had approached the window.

<p>
"Aye, aye," says Dashall, "we shall not be long, I see, without some
object to exercise your mind upon, and dispel the horrors.
</p>
<pre>
          "Oh for that Muse of fire, whose burning pen
          Records the God-like deeds of valiant men!
          Then might our humble, yet aspiring verse,
          Our matchless hero's matchless deeds rehearse."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>Bob was surprised at this sudden exclamation of his cousin, and
from the introduction naturally expected something extraordinary, though
he looked around him without discovering his object.
</p>
<pre>
"That," continued Tom, "is a Peer"&mdash;pointing to a gig just turning the
corner, "of whom it may be said:
          
          To many a jovial club that <i>Peer</i> was known, 
          With whom his active wit unrivall'd shone,
          Choice spirit, grave freemason, buck and blood, 
          Would crowd his stories and <i>bon mots</i> to hear, 
          And none a disappointment e'er need fear
          His humour flow'd in such a copious flood."
</pre>
<p>
"It is Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, who was formerly well known as the celebrated Major
H&mdash;&mdash;, the companion of the now most distinguished personage in the
British dominions! and who not long since became possessed of his
lordly honours. Some particulars of him are worth knowing. He was
early introduced into life, and often kept both good and bad company,
associating with men and women of every description and of every rank,
from the highest to the lowest&mdash;from St. James's to St. Giles's, in
palaces and night-cellars&mdash;from the drawing-room to the dust-cart. He
can drink, swear, tell stories, cudgel, box, and smoke with any one;
having by his intercourse with society fitted himself for all companies.
His education has been more practical than theoretical, though he was
brought up at Eton, where, notwithstanding he made considerable progress
in his studies, he took such an aversion to Greek that he never would
learn it. Previous to his arrival at his present title, he used to be
called Honest George, and so unalterable is his nature, that to this
hour he likes it, and it fits him better than his title. But he has
often been sadly put to his shifts under various circumstances: he was
a courtier, but was too honest for that; he tried gaming, but he was too
honest for that; he got into prison, and might have wiped off, but he
was too honest for that; he got into the coal trade, but he found it a
black business, and he was too honest for that. At drawing the long
bow, so much perhaps cannot be said&mdash;but that you know is habit, not
principle; his courage is undoubted, having fought three duels before he
was twenty years of age.
</p>
<p>
Being disappointed in his hope of promotion in the army, he resolved, in
spite of the remonstrances of his <span class="pagenum">[26]</span>friends, to quit the guards,
and solicited an appointment in one of the Hessian corps, at that
time raising for the British service in America, where the war of the
revolution was then commencing, and obtained from the Landgrave of Hesse
a captain's commission in his corps of Jagers.
</p>
<p>
Previous to his departure for America, finding he had involved himself
in difficulties by a profuse expenditure, too extensive for his income,
and an indulgence in the pleasures of the turf to a very great extent,
he felt himself under the necessity of mortgaging an estate of about
11,000L. per annum, left him by his aunt, and which proved unequal to
the liquidation of his debts. He remained in America till the end of the
war, where he distinguished himself for bravery, and suffered much with
the yellow fever. On his return, he obtained an introduction to the
Prince of Wales, who by that time had lanched into public life, and
became one of the jovial characters whom he selected for his associates;
and many are the amusing anecdotes related of him. The Prince conferred
on him the appointment of equerry, with a salary of 300L. a year; this,
however, he lost on the retrenchments that were afterwards made in the
household of His Royal Highness. He continued, however, to be one of
his constant companions, and while in his favour they were accustomed
to practice strange vagaries. The Major was always a wag, ripe and ready
for a <i>spree or a lark</i>.
</p>
<pre>
          "To him a frolic was a high delight,
          A frolic he would hunt for, day and night,
          Careless how prudence on the sport might frown."
</pre>
<p>
At one time, when the favourite's finances were rather low, and the
<i>mopusses ran taper</i>, it was remarked among the 60 vivants of the
party, that the Major had not for some time given them an invitation.
This, however, he promised to do, and fixed the day&mdash;the Prince
having engaged to make one. Upon this occasion he took lodgings in
Tottenham-court Road&mdash;went to a wine-merchant&mdash;promised to introduce
him to the royal presence, upon his engaging to find wine for the party,
which was readily acceded to; and a dinner of three courses was served
up. Three such courses, perhaps, were never before seen; when the
company were seated, two large dishes appeared; one was placed at the
top of the table, and one at the bottom; all was anxious expectation:
<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>the covers being removed, exhibited to view, a baked shoulder of
mutton at top, and baked potatoes at the bottom. They all looked around
with astonishment, but, knowing the general eccentricity of their host,
they readily fell into his humour, and partook of his fare; not doubting
but the second course would make ample amends for the first. The wine
was good, and the Major apologized for his accommodations, being, as he
said, a family sort of man, and the dinner, though somewhat uncommon,
was not such an one as is described by Goldsmith:
</p>
<pre>
          "At the top, a fried liver and bacon were seen;
          At the bottom was tripe, in a swinging tureen;
          At the sides there were spinach and pudding made hot;
          In the middle a place where the pasty&mdash;was not."
</pre>
<p>
At length the second course appeared; when lo and behold, another baked
shoulder of mutton and baked potatoes! Surprise followed surprise&mdash;but
</p>
<pre>
          "Another and another still succeeds."
</pre>
<p>
The third course consisted of the same fare, clearly proving that he
had in his catering studied quantity more than variety; however, they
enjoyed the joke, eat as much as they pleased, laughed heartily at the
dinner, and after bumpering till a late hour, took their departure: it
is said, however, that he introduced the wine-merchant to his Highness,
who afterwards profited by his orders.{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 This remarkable dinner reminds us of a laughable
     caricature which made its appearance some time ago upon the
     marriage of a Jew attorney, in Jewry-street, Aldgate, to the
     daughter of a well-known fishmonger, of St. Peter's-alley,
     Cornhill, when a certain Baronet, Alderman, Colonel, and
     then Lord Mayor, opened the ball at the London Tavern, as
     the partner of the bride; a circum-stance which excited
     considerable curiosity and surprise at the time. We know the
     worthy Baronet had been a hunter for a seat in Parliament,
     but what he could be hunting among the children of Israel
     is, perhaps, not so easily ascertained. We, however, are not
     speaking of the character, but the caricature, which
     represented the bride, not resting on Abraham's bosom, but
     seated on his knee, surrounded by their guests at the
     marriage-feast; while to a panel just behind them, appears
     to be affixed a bill of fare, which runs thus:

     First course, Fish!

     Second course, Fish!!

     Third course, Fish!!!

     Perhaps the idea of the artist originated in  the anecdote
     above recorded.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>It is reported that the Prince gave him a commission, under an
express promise that when he could not shew it, he was no longer to
enjoy his royal favour. This commission was afterwards lost by the
improvident possessor, and going to call on the donor one morning, who
espying him on his way, he threw up the sash and called out, "Well,
George, commission or no commission?" "No commission, by G&mdash;&mdash;, your
Highness?" was the reply.
</p>
<p>
"Then you cannot enter here," rejoined the prince, closing the window
and the connection at the same time.
</p>
<p>
"His Lordship now resides in the Regent's Park, and may almost nightly
be seen at a public-house in the neighbourhood, where he takes his grog
and smokes his pipe, amusing the company around him with anecdotes of
his former days; we may, perhaps, fall in with him some night in
our travels, and you will find him a very amusing and sometimes very
sensible sort of fellow, till he gets his grog on board, when he can be
as boisterous and blustering as a coal-heaver or a bully. His present
fortune is impaired by his former imprudence, but he still mingles with
the sporting world, and a short time back had his pocket picked, at a
<i>milling</i> match, of a valuable gold repeater. He has favoured the world
with several literary productions, among which are Memoirs of his own
Life, embellished with a view of the author, suspended from (to use the
phrase of a late celebrated auctioneer) a <i>hanging wood</i>; and a very
elaborate treatise on the Art of Rat-catching. In the advertisement of
the latter work, the author engages it will enable the reader to "clear
any house of these noxious vermin, however much infested, excepting
only a certain great House in the neighbourhood of St. Stephen's,
Westminster."{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 It appears by the newspapers, that the foundation of a
     certain great house in Pall Mall is rotten, and giving-way.
     The cause is not stated; but as it cannot arise from being
     top-heavy, we may presume that the rats have been at work
     there. Query, would not an early application of the Major's
     recipe have remedied the evil, and prevented the necessity
     of a removal of a very heavy body, which of course, must be
     attended with a very heavy expense? 'Tis a pity an old
     friend should have been overlooked on such an occasion.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>"Do you," said Tom, pointing to a person on the other side of
the way, "see that young man, walking with a half-smothered air of
indifference, affecting to whistle as he walks, and twirling his
stick? He is a <i>once-a-week man</i>, or, in other words, a <i>Sunday
promenader</i>&mdash;Harry Hairbrain was born of a good family, and, at the
decease of his father, became possessed of ten thousand pounds, which
he sported with more zeal than discretion, so much so, that having been
introduced to the gaming table by a pretended friend, and fluctuated
between poverty and affluence for four years, he found himself
considerably in debt, and was compelled to seek refuge in an obscure
lodging, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kilburn, in order to avoid
the <i>traps</i>; for, as he observes, he has been among the <i>Greeks and
pigeons</i>, who have completely <i>rook'd</i> him, and now want to crow
over him: he has been at hide and seek for the last two months, and,
depending on the death of a rich old maiden aunt who has no other heir,
he eventually hopes to '<i>diddle 'em</i>.'"
</p>
<p>
This narrative of Hairbrain was like Hebrew ta Tallyho, who requested
his interesting cousin, as he found himself at <i>falt, to try back</i>, and
put him on the <i>right scent</i>.
</p>
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" said Tom, "we must find a new London vocabulary, I see,
before we shall be able to converse intelligibly; but as you are now
solely under my tuition, I will endeavour to throw a little light upon
the subject.
</p>
<p>
"Your <i>once-a-week man, or Sunday promenader</i>, is one who confines
himself, to avoid confinement, lodging in remote quarters in the
vicinity of the Metropolis, within a mile or two of the Bridges,
Oxford Street, or Hyde-Park Corner, and is constrained to waste six
uncomfortable and useless days in the week, in order to secure the
enjoyment of the seventh, when he fearlessly ventures forth, to recruit
his ideas&mdash;to give a little variety to the sombre picture of life,
unmolested, to transact his business, or to call on some old friend,
and keep up those relations with the world which would otherwise be
completely neglected or broken.
</p>
<p>
"Among characters of this description, may frequently be recognised the
remnant of fashion, and, perhaps, the impression of nobility not wholly
destroyed by adversity and seclusion&mdash;the air and manners of a man
who has <span class="pagenum">[30]</span>outlived his century, with an assumption of <i>sans souci</i>
pourtrayed in his agreeable smile, murmur'd through a low whistle of
'Begone dull care,' or 'No more by sorrow chased, my heart,' or played
off by the flourishing of a whip, or the rapping of a boot that has
a spur attached to it, which perhaps has not crossed a horse for
many months; and occasionally by a judicious glance at another man's
carriage, horses, or appointments, which indicates taste, and the former
possession of such valuable things. These form a part of the votaries
of Real Life in London. This however," said he (observing his cousin in
mute attention) "is but a gloomy part of the scene; vet, perhaps, not
altogether uninteresting or unprofitable."
</p>
<p>
"I can assure you," replied Tallyho, "I am delighted with the accurate
knowledge you appear to have of society in general, while I regret the
situation of the actors in scenes so glowingly described, and am only
astonished at the appearance of such persons."
</p>
<p>
"You must not be astonished at appearances," rejoined Dashall, "for
appearance is every thing in London; and I must particularly warn you
not to found your judgment upon it. There is an old adage, which says
'To <i>be</i> poor, and <i>seem</i> poor, is the Devil all over.' Why, if you meet
one of these <i>Sunday-men</i>, he will accost you with urbanity and affected
cheerfulness, endeavouring to inspire you with an idea that he is one of
the happiest of mortals; while, perhaps, the worm of sorrow is secretly
gnawing his heart, and preying upon his constitution. Honourable
sentiment, struggling with untoward circumstances, is destroying
his vitals; not having the courage to pollute his character by a
jail-delivery, or to condescend to <i>white-washing</i>, or some low bankrupt
trick, to extricate himself from difficulty, in order to stand upright
again.
</p>
<p>
"A <i>once-a-week man, or Sunday promenader</i>, frequently takes his way
through bye streets and short cuts, through courts and alleys, as it
were between retirement and a desire to see what is going on in the
scenes of his former splendour, to take a sly peep at that world from
which he seems to be excluded."
</p>
<p>
"And for all such men," replied Bob, "expelled from high and from good
society, (even though I were compelled to allow by their own imprudence
and folly) I <span class="pagenum">[31]</span>should always like to have a spare hundred, to send
them in an anonymous cover."
</p>
<p>
"You are right," rejoined Tom, catching him ardently by the hand,
"the sentiment does honour to your head and heart; for to such men, in
general, is attached a heart-broken wife, withering by their side in the
shade, as the leaves and the blossom cling together at all seasons, in
sickness or in health, in affluence or in poverty, until the storm beats
too roughly on them, and prematurely destroys the weakest. But I must
warn you not to let your liberality get the better of your discretion,
for there are active and artful spirits abroad, and even these
necessities and miseries are made a handle for deception, to entrap the
unwary; and you yet have much to learn&mdash;Puff lived two years on sickness
and misfortune, by advertisements in the newspapers."
</p>
<p>
"How?" enquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"You shall have it in his own words," said Dashall.
</p>
<pre>
     "I suppose never man went through such a series of
     "calamities in the same space of time! Sir, I was five
     "times made a bankrupt and reduced from a state of
     "affluence, by a train of unavoidable misfortunes! then
     "Sir, though a very industrious tradesman, I was twice
     "burnt out, and lost my little all both times! I lived
     "upon those fires a month. I soon after was confined by a
     "most excruciating disorder, and lost the use of my limbs!
     "That told very well; for I had the case strongly attested,
     "and went about col&mdash;called on you, a close prisoner
     "in the Marshalsea, for a debt benevolently contracted
     "to serve a friend. I was afterwards twice tapped
     "for a dropsy, which declined into a very profitable
     "consumption! I was then reduced to&mdash;0&mdash;no&mdash;then,
     "I became a widow with six helpless children&mdash;after
     "having had eleven husbands pressed, and being left
     "every time eight months gone with child, and without
     "money to get me into an hospital!"
</pre>
<p>
"Astonishing!" cried Bob, "and are such things possible?"
</p>
<p>
"A month's residence in the metropolis," said Dashall, "will satisfy
your enquiries. One ingenious villain, a short time back, had artifice
enough to defraud the public, at different periods of his life, of
upwards of one hundred thousand pounds, and actually carried on
his fraudulent schemes to the last moment of his existence, for he
<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>defrauded Jack Ketch of his fee by hanging himself in his cell
after condemnation."{1}
</p>
<p>
Just as a tilbury was passing, "Observe," said Tom, "the driver of that
tilbury is the celebrated Lord Cripplegate with his usual equipage&mdash;his
blue cloak with a scarlet lining, hanging loosely over the vehicle,
gives an air of importance to his appearance, and he is always attended
by that boy, who has been denominated his cupid; he is a nobleman
by birth, a gentleman by courtesy, and a gamester by profession. He
exhausted a large estate upon <i>odd and even, sevens the main</i>, &amp;c. till
having lost sight of the <i>main chance</i>, he found it necessary to curtail
his establishment and enliven his prospects, by exchanging a first floor
for a second, without an opportunity of ascertaining whether or not
these alterations were best suited to his high notions or exalted taste;
from which in a short time he was induced, either by inclination or
necessity, to take a small lodging in an obscure street, and to sport
a gig and one horse, instead of a curricle and pair; though in former
times he used to drive four in hand, and was acknowledged to be an
excellent whip. He still, however, possessed money enough to collect
together a large quantity of halfpence, which in his hours of relaxation
he managed to turn to good account, by the following stratagem:&mdash;He
distributed his halfpence on the floor of his little parlour in straight
lines, and ascertained how many it would require to cover it; having
thus prepared himself, he invited some wealthy spendthrifts (with whom
he still had the power of associating) to sup with him, and he welcomed
them to his habitation with much cordiality. The glass circulated
freely, and each recounted his gaming or amorous adventures till a late
hour, when the effects of the bottle becoming visible, he proposed, as a
momentary suggestion, to name how many halfpence laid side by side would
carpet the floor; and offered to lay a large
</p>
<pre>
     1 Charles Price, the well-known impostor, whose extensive
     forgeries on the Bank of England rendered him notorious, may
     serve as a practical illustration of Puff, for he, at
     several periods of his life, carried on his system of fraud
     by advertisements, and by personating the character of a
     clergyman collecting subscriptions under various pretences.
     His whole life is marked with determined and systematic
     depravity. He hanged himself in Tothil-fields Bridewell,
     where he was confined, at the age of fifty-five.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>wager, that he would guess the nearest. Done! done! was echoed
round the room. Every one made a deposit of 100L. and every one made a
guess equally certain of success; and his lordship declaring he had
a large lot of halfpence by him, though, perhaps, not enough, the
experiment was to be tried immediately&mdash;'twas an excellent hit! The room
was cleared, to it they went, the halfpence were arranged rank and file
in military order, when it appeared that his lordship had certainly
guessed (as well he might) nearest to the number: the consequence was,
an immediate alteration of his lordship's residence and appearance: he
got one step in the world by it, he gave up his second-hand gig for
one warranted new; and a change in his vehicle may pretty generally be
considered as the barometer of his pocket.
</p>
<p>
"Do you mark, he is learing at that pretty girl on the other side of the
way? he is fond of the wenches, and has been a true votary of fashion.
Perhaps there is not a more perfect model of Real Life in London than
might be furnished from the memoirs of his lordship! He is rather a good
looking man, as he sits, and prides himself on being a striking likeness
of his present majesty; but, unfortunately, has a lameness which
impedes him in the ardour of his pursuit of game, although it must be
acknowledged he has been a game one in his time. The boy you see with
him is reported to be his own son, who is now employed by him as an
assistant in all his amorous adventures."
</p>
<p>
"His own son!" exclaimed Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Aye, and (if so) a merrily begotten one, I'll be bound for it,"
continued Tom; "such things will happen, and his lordship has kept a
very pretty assortment of servant girls. But the introduction of this
youth to public notice was somewhat curious. It is said, that having a
large party of <i>bon vivants</i> to dine with him, on sitting down to table,
and taking the cover off one of the dishes, a plump and smiling infant
appeared. A sweet little <i>Cupid</i> by
</p>
<p>
&mdash;&mdash;! (exclaimed his lordship) I'll be his father!&mdash;I'll
</p>
<p>
take care of him!&mdash;call Rose, and tell her to look out for a nurse for
him. Thus taking upon himself the character of parent and protector as
well as parson. Young <i>Cupid</i> was christened in libations of claret, and
furnished a fund of amusement for the evening. How young Cupid <span class="pagenum">[34]</span>came
there, I believe has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained:
</p>
<pre>
          Who seeks a friend, should come disposed
          T' exhibit, in full bloom disclosed,
          The graces and the beauties
          That form the character he seeks;
          For 'tis an union that bespeaks
          Reciprocated duties.
</pre>
<p>
And thus it has proved with <i>Cupid</i>, himself the offspring of an illicit
amour, is now constantly engaged in promoting others.
</p>
<p>
"His lordship had three brothers, <i>Billingsgate! Hellgate!</i> and
<i>Newgate!</i> whose names are adorned with a similarity of perfections in
the Temple of Fame; but they are consigned to the tomb of the Capulets,
and we will not rake up the ashes of the dead."{1}
</p>
<p>
At this moment a loud knocking was heard at the door, and Mr. Sparkle
was ushered into the drawing-room, which he entered, as it were, with a
hop, step, and jump, and had Tom Dashall by the hand almost before they
could turn round to see who it was.
</p>
<p>
"My dear fellow!" exclaimed Sparkle, almost out of breath, "where have
you been to? Time has been standing still since your departure!&mdash;there
has been a complete void in nature&mdash;how do you do?&mdash;I beg pardon,
(turning to Bob) you will excuse my rapture at meeting my old friend,
whom I have lost so long, that I have almost lost myself&mdash;egad, I have
run myself out of breath&mdash;cursed unlucky I was not in the Park this
morning to see you first, but I have just heard all about you from Lady
Jane, and lost no time in paying my respects&mdash;what are you going to do
with yourself?"
</p>
<pre>
     1 There was a delicate propriety in this conduct of the Hon.
     Tom Dashall which cannot but be admired; for although they
     were alone, and speaking to each other in perfect
     confidence, it was always his desire to avoid as much as
     possible making bad worse; he had a heart to feel, as well
     as a head to think; and would rather lend a hand to raise a
     fellow-creature from the mud than walk deliberately over
     him; besides, he foresaw other opportunities would arise in
     which, from circumstances, he would almost be compelled to
     draw his Cousin's attention again to the persons in
     question, and he was always unwilling to ex-haust a subject
     of an interesting nature without sonic leading occurrence to
     warrant it.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>At this moment dinner was announced. "Come," said Tom, "let us
refresh a bit, and after dinner I will tell you all about it. We are
travellers, you know, and feel a little fatigued. <i>Allons, allons</i>." And
so saying, he led the way to the dinner-room.
</p>
<p>
"Nothing could be more <i>apropos</i>," said Sparkle, "for although I have
two engagements beforehand, and have promised a visit to you know who in
the evening, they appear like icicles that must melt before the sun of
your re-appearance: so I am your's." And to it they went. Tom always
kept a liberal table, and gave his friends a hearty welcome. But here
it will be necessary, while they are regaling themselves, to make
our readers a little acquainted with Charles Sparkle, Esq.; for which
purpose we must request his patience till the next chapter.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>IT will be seen in the previous chapter, that the formal ceremony
of a fashionable introduction, such as&mdash;"Mr. Sparkle, my friend Mr.
Robert Tallyho, of Belville Hall; Mr. Tallyho, Mr. Charles Sparkle," was
altogether omitted; indeed, the abrupt entrance of the latter rendered
it utterly impossible, for although Sparkle was really a well-bred man,
he had heard from Lady Jane of Tom's arrival with his young friend from
the country. <i>Etiquette</i> between themselves, was at all times completely
unnecessary, an air of gaiety and freedom, as the friend of Dashall, was
introduction enough to Bob, and consequently this point of good breeding
was wholly unnoticed by all the party; but we are not yet sufficiently
acquainted with our readers to expect a similar mode of proceeding will
be overlooked; we shall therefore lose no time in giving our promised
account of Mr. Sparkle, and beg to introduce him accordingly.

<p>
Mr. Reader, Mr. Sparkle; Mr. Sparkle, Mr. Reader.

<p>
Hold, Sir, what are you about? You have bewildered yourself with

<p>
Mr. Author, you are a strange rambler.
</p>
<p>
Admitted, Sir, or Ma'am, I am a rambler, who, with your permission,
would willingly not be impeded in my progress, and under such
expectations I shall proceed.
</p>
<p>
Charles Sparkle was the son and only child of a Right Hon. Member of
Parliament, now no more, whose mother dying soon after his birth, was
left destitute of that maternal kindness and solicitude which frequently
has so much influence in forming the character of the future man.
</p>
<p>
His father, a man of eccentric turn of mind, being appointed soon
afterwards to a diplomatic situation abroad, left the care of his son's
education to an elderly friend of his, who held a situation of some
importance under the then existing government, with an injunction to
conceal from the boy the knowledge of his real parent, and to bring him
up as his own child.
</p>
<p>
This important trust was executed with tenderness and fidelity; the boy
grew in strength, and ripened in intelligence, and being accustomed
to consider his protector as his parent, the father, upon returning
to England, determined not to undeceive him, until he should arrive at
years of discretion; and with this view Mr. Orford was instructed at a
proper age to send him to Oxford.
</p>
<p>
Charles, however had contracted before this period, habits and
acquaintances in London, that were completely in opposition to the
dictates and inclinations of his supposed father. He became passionately
fond of literary amusements, music, and drawing, which served to occupy
his morning hours: but his evenings were devoted to the company of
vitiated associates, who did <span class="pagenum">[38]</span>not fail to exercise their influence
over his youthful passions, and he frequently engaged himself in unlucky
and improvident adventures, which involved him in pecuniary difficulties
far beyond his stipulated income. These circumstances were no sooner
made known to the supposed parent, than they excited his displeasure,
and being carried to an unpardonable extent, he was, at the age of
eighteen, literally banished the house of his protector, and compelled
to take an obscure lodging in the vicinity of London; the rent of which
was paid for him, and a scanty allowance of one guinea sent to him
regularly every Saturday night. Thus secluded from his old associates,
it will not be wondered at that he contrived to form new ones, and
having purchased an old harpsicord, turned the musical instruction
he had received to occasional account; he also wrote some political
pamphlets which were well received. But this solitary and dependent life
was wholly unsuited to the gaiety in which he had hitherto moved. It
had, however, the effect of drawing forth talent, which perhaps would
never, but for this circumstance, have been discovered; for
</p>
<pre>
          "Many a gem, of purest ray serene,
          The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;
          Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
          And waste its sweetness on the desert air."
</pre>
<p>
His writings, &amp;c. under the name of Oribrd, were recognised by the real
father, as the productions of a promising son: at his instigation, and
upon a promise of reform, he was again restored to his former home, and
shortly after entered as a gentleman commoner of St. Mary's, Oxford; but
not till he had, by some means or other, made the discovery that
Orford was not his real name. Congenial spirits are naturally fond of
associating, and it was here that he first became acquainted with the
Hon. Tom Dashall: they were constant companions and mutual assistants to
each other, in all their exercises as well as all their vagaries; so
as to cement a friendship and interest in each other's fate, up to the
moment of which we are now speaking.
</p>
<p>
Orford, however, was at that time more impetuous and less discreet
in the pursuit of his pleasures than his honourable friend, and after
obtaining the distinction of Bachelor of Arts, was in consequence of
his imprudence and <span class="pagenum">[39]</span>irregularities, after frequently hair-breadth
escapes, expelled the college. This circumstance, however, appeared of
little consequence to him. He hired a gig at Oxford, promising to return
in a few days, and came up to London, but had not effrontery enough to
venture into the presence of his reputed father. On arrival in town, he
put up at an inn in the Borough, where he resided till all the money
he had was exhausted, and till, as he emphatically observes, he had
actually eaten his horse and chaise.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time, the people at Oxford found he was expelled; and as
he had not returned according to appointment, he was pursued, and
eventually found: they had no doubt of obtaining their demand from
his friends, and he was arrested at the suit of the lender; which was
immediately followed by a retainer from the inn-keeper where he had
resided in town. Application was made to Mr. Orford for his liberation,
without effect; in consequence of which he became a resident in the
rules of the King's Bench, as his friends conceived by this means his
habits would be corrected and his future conduct be amended, his real
father still keeping in the back ground.
</p>
<p>
While in this confinement, he again resorted to the produce of his pen
and his talent for musical composition, and his friend Tom, at the first
vacation, did not fail to visit him. During this time, in the shape
of donation, from Mr. Orford he received occasional supplies more than
equal to his necessities, though not to his wishes. While here, he
fished out some further clue to the real parent, who visited him in
disguise during his confinement as a friend of Mr. Orford: still,
however, he had no chance of liberation, till, being one day called on
by Mr. Orford, he was informed he was at perfect liberty to leave his
present abode, and was directed to go with him immediately; a coach was
called, and he heard the direction given to drive to Bedford Square,
where they arrived just time enough to learn that the Right Hon. S. S.
had breathed his last, after a lingering illness.
</p>
<p>
Upon alighting from the coach, and receiving this information, they were
ushered into the drawing-room, and presently joined by a clergyman who
had been the chaplain of the deceased, who acquainted our adventurer of
the death of his parent&mdash;that by will he was entitled <span class="pagenum">[40]</span>to 10,000L.
per annum, and a handsome estate in Wiltshire. This sudden reverse
of fortune to Sparkle&mdash;the change from confinement to liberty, from
indigence to affluence&mdash;awakened sensations more easily to be conceived
than described. He wept, (perhaps the first tears of sincerity in his
life; ) his heart was subdued by an overwhelming flood of affection for
that unknown being, whom he now found had been his constant guardian
angel, alternately taking Orford and the reverend Divine by the hand,
and hiding his head in the bosom of his reputed father. At length they
led him to the room in which were the remains of his lamented parent.
</p>
<p>
There are perhaps few circumstances better calculated to impress awe
on the youthful mind than the contemplation of those features in death
which have been respected and revered while living. Such respect had
ever been entertained by Charles Sparkle for the supposed friend of
Mr. Orford, from whom he had several times received the most kind and
affectionate advice; and his sensations upon discovering that friend
to be no other than his own father, may be more easily conceived than
described&mdash;he was at once exalted and humbled, delighted and afflicted.
He threw himself in an agony of feeling by the bed-side, fell on his
knees, in which he was joined by the clergyman and Orford, where he
remained some time.
</p>
<p>
After the first paroxysms of grief had subsided, young Sparkle, who had
already felt the strongest impression that could possibly be made on
a naturally good heart, gave orders for the funeral of his deceased
father, and then proceeded to make other arrangements suitable to
the character he was hereafter to sustain through life, went down
to Wiltshire, and took possession of his estate, where for a time he
secluded himself, and devoted his attention to the perusal of the
best authors in the English, French, and Italian language, under the
superintendence of the reverend Divine, who had been a resident for many
years with his father.
</p>
<p>
But a life in the country could not long have superior charms for a
young man who had already seen much to admire, as well as much to avoid,
in the metropolis. The combination however of theoretical information
he had derived from books, as well as the practical observations he had
made during his residence in London, fitted him at once for the
gayest and most distinguished circles of <span class="pagenum">[41]</span>metropolitan society.
He therefore arranged with Mr. Orford, who had formerly acted as his
parent, to continue with him in the capacity of steward, and for the
last two years of his life had been almost a constant resident at
"Long's Hotel", in Bond Street, not choosing to have the charge of an
establishment in town; and the early friendship and attachment which
had been cultivated at Oxford being again renewed, appeared to grow with
their growth, and strengthen with their strength.
</p>
<p>
Sparkle had still a large portion of that vivacity for which he was so
remarkable in his younger days. His motives and intentions were at all
times good, and if he indulged himself in the pursuits of frolic and
fun, it was never at the expence of creating an unpleasant feeling to an
honest or honourable mind. His fortune was ample. He had a hand to give,
and a heart to forgive; no "malice or hatred were there to be found:"
but of these qualifications, and the exercise of them, sufficient traits
will be given in the ensuing pages. No man was better <i>up</i> to the rigs
of the town; no one better <i>down</i> to the manoeuvres of the <i>flats</i>, and
<i>sharps</i>. He had mingled with life in all companies; he was at once an
elegant and interesting companion; his views were extensive upon all
subjects; his conversation lively, and his manners polished.
</p>
<p>
Such, gentle reader, is the brief sketch of Charles Sparkle, the
esteemed friend of the Hon. Tom Dashall, and with such recommendations
it will not be wondered at if he should become also the friend of
Tally-ho; for, although living in the height of fashionable splendour,
his mind was at all times in consonance with the lines which precede
this chapter; yet none could be more ready to lend a hand in any
pleasant party in pursuit of a bit of <i>gig. A mill at Moulsey Hurst&mdash;a
badger-bait, or bear-bait&mdash;a main at the Cock-pit&mdash;a smock-race</i>&mdash;or
a scamper to the Tipping hunt, ultimately claimed his attention; while
upon all occasions he was an acute observer of life and character.
</p>
<pre>
          "His years but young, but his experience old,
          His heart unmellow'd, though his judgment ripe,
          And in a word, (for far behind his worth
          Come all the praises that we now bestow)
          He is complete in conduct and in mind,
          With all good grace, to grace a gentleman."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>But dinner is over, and we must now accompany our triumvirate to
the drawing-room, where we find them seated with bottles, glasses, &amp;c.
determined to make a quiet evening after the fatigues of the journey,
and with a view to prepare themselves for the more arduous, and to
Tally-ho more interesting, pursuits in the new world, for such he almost
considered London.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Sparkle, addressing himself to Bob, with whom a little
previous conversation had almost rendered him familiar, "London is a
world within itself; it is, indeed, the only place to see life&mdash;it is
the "<i>multum in parvo</i>," as the old song says,
</p>
<pre>
          "Would you see the world in little,
          Ye curious here repair;"
</pre>
<p>
it is the acmé of perfection, the "<i>summum bonum</i>" of style&mdash;-indeed,
there is a certain affectation of style from the highest to the lowest
individual."
</p>
<p>
"You are a merry and stylish fellow," said Tom; we should have been
hipp'd without you, there is a fund of amusement in you at all times."
</p>
<p>
"You are a bit of a wag," replied Sparkle, "but I am up to your gossip,
and can serve you out in your own style."
</p>
<p>
"Every body," says Tallyho, "appears to live in style."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," continued Sparkle, "<i>living in style</i> is one of the most
essential requisites for a residence in London; but I'll give you my
idea of living in style, which, by many, is literally nothing more
than keeping up appearances at other people's expence: for instance, a
Duchess conceives it to consist in taking her breakfast at three o'clock
in the afternoon&mdash;dining at eight&mdash;playing at Faro till four the next
morning&mdash;supping at five, and going to bed at six&mdash;and to eat green peas
and peaches in January&mdash;in making a half-curtsey at the creed, and a
whole one to a scoundrel&mdash;in giving fifty guineas to an exotic capon for
a pit-ticket&mdash;and treating the deserved claims of a parental actor with
contempt&mdash;to lisp for the mere purpose of appearing singular, and to
seem completely ignorant of the Mosaic law&mdash;to be in the reverse of
extremes&mdash;to laugh when she could weep, and weep when she could .dance
and be merry&mdash;to leave her compliment cards with her acquaintance, whom
at the same moment she wishes she may never see again&mdash;to speak of the
community <span class="pagenum">[43]</span>with marked disrespect, and to consider the sacrament a
bore!"
</p>
<p>
"Admirable!" said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Wonderful, indeed!" exclaimed Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"Aye, aye, London is full of wonders&mdash;there is a general and insatiate
appetite for the marvellous; but let us proceed: Now we'll take the
reverse of the picture. The Duke thinks he does things in style, by
paying his debts of honour contracted at the gaming-table, and but very
few honourable debts&mdash;by being harsh and severe to a private supplicant,
while he is publicly a liberal subscriber to a person he never saw&mdash;by
leaving his vis-a-vis at the door of a well-known courtesan, in order
to have the credit of an intrigue&mdash;in making use of an optical glass for
personal inspection, though he can ascertain the horizon without any&mdash;by
being or seeming to be, every thing that is in opposition to nature and
virtue&mdash;in counting the lines in the Red Book, and carefully watching
the importation of <i>figurantes</i> from the Continent&mdash;in roundly declaring
that a man of fashion is a being of a superior order, and ought to be
amenable only to himself&mdash;in jumbling ethics and physics together, so as
to make them destroy each other&mdash;in walking arm in arm with a sneering
jockey&mdash;talking loudly any thing but sense&mdash;and in burning long letters
without once looking at their contents;... and so much for my Lord
Duke."
</p>
<p>
"Go along Bob!" exclaimed Tom.
</p>
<p>
Tallyho conceiving himself addressed by this, looked up with an air
of surprise and enquiry, which excited the risibility of Dashall and
Sparkle, till it was explained to him as a common phrase in London, with
which he would soon become more familiar. Sparkle continued.
</p>
<p>
"The gay young Peerling, who is scarcely entitled to the honours and
immunities of manhood, is satisfied he is <i>doing things in style</i>, by
raising large sums of money on <i>post-obit</i> bonds, at the very moderate
premium of 40 per cent.&mdash;in <i>queering</i> the clergyman at his father's
table, and leaving the marks of his finger and thumb on the article
of matrimony in his aunt's prayer-book&mdash;in kicking up a row at the
theatre, when he knows he has some roaring bullies at his elbow, though
humble and dastardly when alone&mdash;in keeping a dashing <i>impure</i>,
who publicly squanders away his money, and privately laughs at
his follies&mdash;in buying a phaeton as high as a two pair of stairs
<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>window, and a dozen of spanking bays at Tattersall's, and in
dashing through St. James's Street, Pall Mall, Piccadilly, and Hyde
Park, thus accompanied and accoutred, amidst the contumelies of the
coxcombs and the sighs of the worthy. And these are pictures of high
life, of which the originals are to be seen daily.
</p>
<p>
"The haberdasher of Cheapside, whose father, by adherence to the
most rigid economy, had amassed a competence, and who transmitted his
property, without his prudence, to his darling son, is determined to
shew his spirit, by buying a <i>bit of blood</i>, keeping his gig, his girl,
and a thatched cottage on the skirts of Epping Forest, or Sydenham
Common; but as keeping a girl and a gig would be a nothing unless
all the world were <i>up to it</i>, he regularly drives her to all the
boxing-matches, the Epping hunt, and all the races at Barnet, Epsom,
Egham, and Ascot Heath, where he places himself in one of the most
conspicuous situations; and as he knows his racing, &amp;c. must eventually
distinguish his name in the Gazette with a whereas! he rejoices in the
progress and acceleration of his own ruin, and, placing his arms akimbo,
he laughs, sings, swears, swaggers, and vociferates&mdash;'What d'ye think o'
that now,&mdash;is'nt this doing it in stile, eh?'
</p>
<p>
"Prime of life to go it, where's a place like London? Four in hand
to-day, the next you may be undone."

"Well, Sir, the mercer's wife, from Watling Street, thinks living
in style is evinced by going once a year to a masquerade at the new
Museodeum, or Argyle Rooms; having her daughters taught French, dancing,
and music&mdash;dancing a minuet at Prewterers' Hall, or Mr. Wilson's{1}

<pre>
     1 Mr. Wilson's flaming bills of "Dancing at the Old Bailey,"
     which are so profusely stuck up about the city, are said to
     have occasioned several awkward jokes and blunders; among
     others related, is that of a great unintellectual Yorkshire
     booby, who, after staring at the bills with his mouth open,
     and his saucer eyes nearly starting out of his head with
     astonishment, exclaimed, "Dang the buttons on't, I zee'd urn

"So much for living in style, and good breeding."
</p>
<pre>
          "That's your true breeding&mdash;that's your sort my boys&mdash;
          Fun, fire, and pathos&mdash;metre, mirth, and noise;
          To make you die with laughter, or the hiccups,
          Tickle your favourites, or smash your tea-cups."
</pre>
<p>
"By the way, in former times the term <i>good-breeding</i> meant a
combination of all that was amiable and excellent; and a well-bred
person would shrink from an action or expression that could possibly
wound the feelings of another; its foundation was laid in truth, and
its supporting pillars were justice and integrity, sensibility and
philanthropy; but
</p>
<pre>
          "In this gay age&mdash;in Taste's enlighten'd times,
          When Fashion sanctifies the basest crimes;
          E'en not to swear and game were impolite,
          Since he who sins in <i>style</i> must sure be right."
</pre>
<p>
A well-bred person must learn to smile when he is angry, and to laugh
even when he is vexed to the very soul.
</p>
<p>
"It would be the height of <i>mauvaise honte</i> for a wellbred person to
blush upon any occasions whatever; no young lady blushes after eleven
years of age; to study the expression of the countenance of others, in
order to govern your own, is indispensably necessary.
</p>
<p>
"In former times, no well-bred person would have uttered a falsehood;
but now such ideas are completely exploded, and such conduct would now
be termed a <i>bore</i>. My Lord Portly remarks, 'It is a cold day.' 'Yes, my
Lord, it is a very cold day,' replies Major Punt. In two minutes after,
meeting Lord Lounge, who observes he thinks the weather very warm&mdash;'Yes,
very warm, my Lord,' is the reply&mdash;thus contradicting himself almost in
the same breath. It would be perfectly inconsistent in a well-bred
man to think, for fear of being absent. When he enters or leaves a
drawing-room, he should round his shoulders, drop his head, and
imitate a clown or a coachman. This has the effect of the best <i>ruse
de guerre</i>&mdash;for it serves to astonish the ladies, when they afterwards
<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>discover, by the familiarity of his address, and his unrestrained
manners, what a well-bred man he is; for he will address every fair one
in the room in the most enchanting terms, except her to whom in the same
party he had previously paid the most particular attention; and on her
he will contrive to turn his back for the whole evening, and if he is a
man of fashion, he will thus cause triumph to the other ladies, and save
the neglected fair one from envious and slanderous whisperings."
</p>
<p>
"An admirable picture of living in style, and good breeding, indeed!"
cried Tom. "The game is in view and well worth pursuit; so hark forward!
hark forward! my boys."
</p>
<p>
Sparkle, now recollecting his engagement&mdash;with "you know who" as he
significantly observed in the last Chapter, withdrew, after promising to
take a stroll by way of killing an hour or two with them in the morning;

    CHAPTER VI
</h2>
<pre>
          "The alarm was so strong.
          So loud and so long,
          'Twas surely some robber, or sprite,
          Who without any doubt
          Was prowling about
          To fill ev'ry heart with affright."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>THE smiles of a May morning, bedecked with the splendid rays of a
rising sun, awakened Tallyho about five o'clock, and being accustomed to
rise early in the country, he left the downy couch of soft repose, and
sought his way down stairs. Not a sound of any kind was to be heard in
the house, but the rattling of the carts and the coaches in the streets,
with the deep-toned accompaniment of a dustman's bell, and an occasional
<i>ab libitum</i> of "Clothes&mdash;clothes sale," gave Bob an idea that all the
world was moving. However he could find nobody up; he walked into the
drawing-room, amused himself for some time by looking out of the window,
indulging his observations and remarks, without knowing what to make of
the moving mass of incongruities which met his eye, and wondering what
time the servants of the house would wake: he tried the street-door, but
found it locked, bolted, and chained; and if he had known where to have
found his friend Tom, he would have aroused him with <i>the View halloo</i>.
</p>
<p>
"It is strange," thought he to himself, "all the world seems abroad,
and yet not a soul stirring here!" Then checking the current of his
reflections, "But this," said he, "is Life in London. Egad! I must not
make a noise, because it will not be <i>good breeding</i>." In this wray he
sauntered about the house for near two hours, till at last espying his
portmanteau, which had been left in the passage by the servants the
previous evening&mdash;"I'll carry this up stairs," said he, "by way of
amusement;" and carelessly shouldering the portmanteau, he was walking
<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>deliberately up stairs, when his ears were suddenly attracted by a
loud cry of "Murder, murder, thieves, murder!" and the violent ringing
of a bell. Alarmed at these extraordinary sounds, which appeared to be
near him at a moment when he conceived no soul was stirring, he dropped
his portmanteau over the banisters, which fell, (demolishing in its way
an elegant Grecian patent lamp with glass shades, drops, &amp;c.) into the
passage below with a hideous crash, while the cry of Murder, thieves,
murder, was repeated by many voices, and rendered him almost immoveable.
In the next moment, the butler, the cook, the groom, and indeed every
person in the house, appeared on the stair-case, some almost in a state
of nudity, and shrinking from each other's gaze, and all armed with
such weapons as chance had thrown in their way, to attack the supposed
depredator.
</p>
<p>
Among the rest, fortunately for Tallyho, (who stood balancing himself
against the banisters in a state of indecision whether he should ascend
or descend) Tom Dashall in his night-gown burst out of his room in alarm
at the noise, with a brace of pistols, one in his hand in the very act
of cocking it, and the other placed in convenient readiness under his
left arm. "Why, what the devil is the matter?" vociferated he, and at
that moment his eye caught the agitated figure of his Cousin Bob, on the
half-landing place below him. At the sound of his well-known voice, the
innocent and unsuspecting cause of this confusion and alarm looked up
at his friend, as if half afraid and half ashamed of the occurrence, and
stammered out, "Where is the thief?&mdash;Who is murdered?&mdash;I'll swear there
is something broke somewhere&mdash;tell me which way to go!" Tom looked
around him at the group of half-clad nymphs and swains, (who were now
huddling together, conceiving their security lay in combination, and
finding all eyes were placed with astonishment and wonder on Bob) began
to see through what had happened, and burst into an immoderate fit of
laughter; which relieved the frightened damsels, but so confounded poor
Tallyho, that he scarcely knew whether he was standing on his head or
his heels. "Why," said Tom, addressing himself to his Cousin, "you will
get yourself murdered if you go wandering about people's houses at the
dead of the night in this manner&mdash;are you asleep or awake?&mdash;who have you
made an assignation with&mdash;or <span class="pagenum">[49]</span>where are you going to&mdash;what are you
up to, Master Bobby, eh?&mdash;These tricks won't do here!"
</p>
<pre>
          "Is't Love's unhallow'd flame invites to roam,
          And bids you from your pillow creep?
          Or say, why thus disturb my peaceful home,
          Like Macbeth, who doth murder sleep."
</pre>
<p>
Tallyho was unable to reply: he looked down over the banister&mdash;he looked
up at the risible features of Tom Dashall, who was almost bursting at
the ludicrous situation in which he found his friend and his servants.
"Come," said Tom, "there are no thieves&mdash;all's right"&mdash;to the
servants, "you may quiet your minds and go to business. Bob, I'll be
down with you presently." Upon this, the stair-case was cleared in an
instant of all but the unfortunate Tallyho; and peace appeared to
be restored in the family, but not to Bob's mind, conceiving he had
committed a gross violation of good breeding, and shewn but a bad
specimen of his aptitude to become a learner of London manners. It must
be confessed, it was rather an awkward commencement; however, in a few
minutes, recovering himself from the fright, he crawled gently down the
stairs, and took a survey of the devastation he had made&mdash;cursed the
lamp, d&mdash;&mdash;d the portmanteau&mdash;then snatching it from the ruin before
him, and again placing his luggage on his shoulder, he quietly walked up
stairs to his bed-room.

It is much to be lamented in this wonderful age of discovery and
continual improvement, that our philosophers have not yet found out a
mode of supplying the place of glass (as almost every thing else) with
cast-iron. The substitution of gas for oil has long been talked of, as
one of national importance, even so much so, that one man, whose ideas
were as brilliant as his own experiments, has endeavoured to shew that
its produce would in a short time pay off the national debt!{1}
</p>
<p>
"A consummation devoutly to be wished;" and experience has taught the
world at large there is nothing impossible, nor is there any one in
existence more credulous than honest John Bull. But we are

     Pall Mall.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>digressing from the adventure of the lamp, however it was
occasioned, by clearly proving it was not a <i>patent safety-lamp</i>: and
that among the luxuries of the Hon. Tom Dashall's habitation, gas had
not yet been introduced, will speedily be discovered.
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving in his bed-room, wondering within himself how he should
repair the blundering mistake, of which he had so unluckily been the
unwilling and unconscious author, he found himself in a new dilemma,
as the receptacle of the oil had fallen with the lamp, and plentifully
bedewed the portmanteau with its contents, so that he had now
transferred the savoury fluid to his coat, waistcoat, cravat, and shirt.
What was to be done in such a case? He could not make his appearance in
that state; but his mortifications were not yet at an end&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Hills over hills, and Alps on Alps arise."
</pre>
<p>
The key of his portmanteau was missing; he rummaged all his pockets
in vain&mdash;he turned them inside out&mdash;it was not here&mdash;it was not
there; enraged at the multiplicity of disappointments to which he was
subjected, he cut open the leathern carriage of his wardrobe with
a penknife; undressed, and re-dressed himself; by which time it was
half-past eight o'clock. His Cousin Tom, who had hurried down according
to promise, had in the mean time been making enquiry after him, and now
entered the room, singing,
</p>
<pre>
          "And all with attention would eagerly mark:
          When he cheer'd up the pack&mdash;Hark! to Rockwood hark! hark!"
</pre>
<p>
At the sight of Dashall, he recovered himself from his embarrassment,
and descended with him to the breakfast-parlour.
</p>
<p>
"Did you send to Robinson's?" enquired Tom of one of the servants, as
they entered the room. "Yes, Sir," was the reply; "and Weston's too?"
continued he; being answered in the affirmative, "then let us have
breakfast directly." Then turning to Bob, "Sparkle," said he, "promised
to be with us about eleven, for the purpose of taking a stroll; in the
mean time we must dress and make ready."&mdash;"Dress," said Bob, "Egad!
I have dressed and made ready twice already this morning." He then
<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>recounted the adventures above recorded; at which Dashall
repeatedly burst into fits of immoderate laughter. Breakfast being over,
a person from Mr. Robinson's was announced, and ushered into the room.
</p>
<p>
A more prepossessing appearance had scarcely met Bob's eye&mdash;a tall,
elegant young man, dressed in black, cut in the extreme of fashion,
whose features bespoke intelligence, and whose air and manner were
indicative of a something which to him was quite new. He arose upon his
entrance, and made a formal bow; which was returned by the youth. "Good
morning, gentlemen."&mdash;"Good morning, Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;," said Tom, mentioning
a name celebrated by
</p>
<p>
Pope in the following lines:
</p>
<pre>
          "But all my praises, why should lords engross?
          Bise, honest Muse, and sing the man of Boss."
</pre>
<p>
"I am happy to have the honour of seeing you in town again, Sir!
The fashionables are mustering very strong, and the prospect of the
approaching coronation appears to be very attractive." During this
time he was occupied in opening a leathern case, which contained combs,
brushes, &amp;c.; then taking off his coat, he appeared in a jacket with an
apron, which, like a fashionable <i>pinafore</i> of the present day, nearly
concealed his person, from his chin to his toes. "Yes," replied Dashall,
"the coronation is a subject of deep importance just now in the
circles of fashion," seating himself in his chair, in readiness for the
operator,{1} who, Bob now discovered, was no other than the <i>Peruquier</i>.
</p>
<pre>
     1 The progress of taste and refinement is visible in all
     situations, and the language of putting has become so well
     understood by all ranks of society, that it is made use of
     by the most humble and obscure tradesmen of the metropolis.
     One remarkable instance ought not to be omitted here. In a
     narrow dirty street, leading from the Temple towards
     Blackfriars, over a small triangular-fronted shop, scarcely
     big enough to hold three persons at a time, the eye of the
     passing traveller is greeted with the following welcome
     information, painted in large and legible characters, the
     letters being each nearly a foot in size:&mdash;

                   HAIR CUT AND MODERNIZED!!!

     This is the true "<i>Multum in parvo</i> "&mdash;a combination of
     the "<i>Utile et dulce</i>," the very acme of perfection.
     Surely, after this, to Robinson, Vickery, Boss, and Cryer, we
     may say&mdash;"Ye lesser stars, hide your diminished heads."

     The art of puffing may be further illustrated by the
     following specimen of the Sublime, which is inserted here
     for the information of such persons as, residing in the
     country, have had no opportunity of seeing the original.
     "R&mdash;&mdash; makes gentlemen's and ladies' perukes on an entire
     new system; which for lightness, taste, and ease, are
     superior to any other in Europe. He has exerted the genius
     and abilities of the first artists to complete his
     exhibition of ornamental hair, in all its luxuriant
     varieties, where the elegance of nature and convenience of
     art are so blended, as at once to rival and ameliorate each
     other. Here his fair patrons may uninterruptedly examine the
     effects of artificial tresses, or toupees of all
     complexions, and, in a trial on themselves, blend the
     different tints with their own!"

     The strife for pre-eminence in this art is not however
     confined to this country; for we find an instance recorded
     in an American newspaper, which may perhaps be equally
     amusing and acceptable:&mdash;

     "A. C. D. La vigne, having heard of the envious expressions
     uttered by certain common barbers, miserable chin-scrapers,
     and frizulary quacks, tending to depreciate that superiority
     which genius is entitled to, and talents will invariably
     command, hereby puts them and their vulgar arts at defiance;
     and, scorning to hold parley with such sneaking imps,
     proposes to any gentleman to defend and maintain, at his
     shop, the head quarters of fashion, No. 6, South Gay Street,
     against all persons whomsoever, his title to supremacy in
     curlery, wiggery, and razory, to the amount of one hundred
     dollars and upwards. As hostile as he is to that low style
     of puffery adopted by a certain adventurer, 'yclept Higgins,
     Lavigne cannot avoid declaring, in the face of the world,
     that his education has been scientifical; that after having
     finished his studies at Paris, he took the tour of the
     universe, having had the rare fortune of regulating the
     heads of Catherine the Second, and the Grand Turk; the King
     of Prussia, and the Emperor of China; the Mamelukes of
     Egypt, and the Dey of Algiers; together with all the ladies
     of their respective Courts. He has visited the Cape of Good
     Hope, India, Java, Madagascar, Tartary, and Kamschatka,
     whence he reached the United States by the way of Cape Horn.
     In England he had previously tarried, where he delivered
     Lectures on Heads in great style. He has at last settled in
     Baltimore, determined to devote the remainder of his days to
     the high profession to which his des-tiny has called him;
     inviting all the literati, the lovers of the arts and
     sciences, to visit him at his laboratory of beauty, where he
     has separate rooms for accommodating ladies and gentlemen,
     who desire to adorn their heads with <i>hair</i>udition. "Can
     France, England&mdash;nay, the world itself, produce such
     another specimen of puffing and barberism?
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>"And pray," continued Tom, "what is there new in the haut ton?
Has there been any thing of importance to attract attention since my
absence? "Nothing very particular," was the reply&mdash;"all very dull and
flat. Rumour however, as usual, has not been inactive; two or three
trifling faux pas, and&mdash;oh!&mdash;yes&mdash;two duels&mdash;one in the literary world:
two authors, who, after attacking each other with the quill, chose to
decide their quarrel with the pistol, and poor Scot lost his life! But
how should authors understand such things? The other has made a great
noise in the world&mdash;You like the Corinthian cut, I believe, Sir?"
</p>
<p>
"I believe so too," said Tom&mdash;"but don't you cut the duel so short&mdash;who
were the parties?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! aye, why one, Sir, was a celebrated leader of ton, no other than
Lord Shampêtre, and the other Mr. Webb, a gentleman well known: it was
a sort of family affair. His lordship's gallantry and courage,
however, were put to the test, and the result bids fair to increase his
popularity. The cause was nothing very extraordinary, but the effect had
nearly proved fatal to his Lordship."
</p>
<p>
"What, was he wounded?" enquired Tom.
</p>
<p>
"It was thought so at first," replied the <i>Peruquier</i>, "but it was
afterwards discovered that his Lordship had only fainted at the report
of his opponent's pistol."
</p>
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" said Tom, "then it was a bloodless battle&mdash;but I should
like to know more of the particulars."
</p>
<p>
"Hold your head a little more this way, Sir, if you please&mdash;that will
do, I thank you, Sir;&mdash;why, it appears, that in attempting to fulfil an
assignation with Mr. Webb's wife, the husband, who had got scent of
the appointment, as to place and time, lustily cudgelled the dandy Lord
Whiskerphiz, and rescued his own brows from certain other fashionable
appendages, for which he had no relish. His Lordship's whiskers were
injured, by which circumstance some people might conceive his features
and appearance must have been improved, however that was not his
opinion; his bones were sore, and his mind (that is to say, as
the public supposed) hurt. The subject became a general theme of
conversation, a Commoner had thrashed a Lord!&mdash;flesh and blood could not
bear it&mdash;but then such flesh and blood could as little bear the thought
of a duel&mdash;Lord Polly was made the bearer of a challenge&mdash;a meeting took
place, and at the first fire his Lordship fell. A fine subject for the
caricaturists, and they have not failed to make a good use of it. The
fire of his Lordship's features <span class="pagenum">[54]</span>was so completely obscured by his
whiskers and mustachios, that it was immediately concluded the shot had
proved mortal, till Lord Polly (who had taken refuge for safety behind a
neighbouring tree) advancing, drew a bottle from his pocket, which,
upon application to his nose, had the desired effect of restoring
the half-dead duellist to life and light. The Seconds interfered, and
succeeded in bringing the matter to a conclusion, and preventing the
expected dissolution of Shampetre, who, report says, has determined not
to place himself in such a perilous situation again. The fright
caused him a severe illness, from which he has scarcely yet recovered
sufficiently to appear in public&mdash;I believe that will do, Sir; will you
look in the glass&mdash;can I make any alteration?"
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps not in your story," replied Tom; "and as to my head, so as you
do not make it like the one you have been speaking of, I rely solely on
your taste and judgment."
</p>
<p>
The Peruquier made his bow&mdash;"Sir, your politeness is well known!" then
turning to Tallyho, "Will you allow me the honour of officiating for
you, Sir?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly," replied Bob, who by this time had seen the alteration made
in his Cousin's appearance, as well as been delighted with the account
of the duel, at which they all laughed during the narration&mdash;and
immediately prepared for action, while Dashall continued his enquiries
as to the fashionable occurrences during his absence.
</p>
<p>
"There have been some other circumstances, of minor importance,"
continued the Peruquier&mdash;"it is said that a certain Lord, of high
military character, has lost considerable sums of money, and seriously
impaired his fortune&mdash;Lord &mdash;&mdash; and a friend are completely ruined at
hazard&mdash;there was a most excellent mill at Moulsey Hurst on Thursday
last, between the Gas-light man, who appears to be a game chicken, and a
prime hammerer&mdash;he can give and take with any man&mdash;and Oliver&mdash;Gas beat
him hollow, it was all Lombard-street to a china orange. The Masked
Festival on the 18th is a subject of considerable attraction, and
wigs of every nature, style, and fashion, are in high request for the
occasion&mdash;The Bob, the Tye, the Natural Scratch, the Full Bottom, the
Queue, the Curl, the Clerical, the Narcissus, the Auricula, the Capital,
the Corinthian, the Roman, the Spanish, the French, the Dutch&mdash;oh! we
are full of business just now. Speaking of the art, by the by, reminds
me of a circumstance which occurred a very <span class="pagenum">[55]</span>short time back, and
which shows such a striking contrast between the low-bred citizens,
and the True Blues of the West!&mdash;have the kindness to hold your head a
little on one side, Sir, if you please&mdash;a little more towards the light,
if you please&mdash;that will do excellently&mdash;why you'll look quite another
thing!&mdash;From the country, I presume?" "You are right," said Bob, "but I
don't want a wig just yet."
</p>
<p>
"Shall be happy to fit you upon all occasions&mdash;masquerade, ball, or
supper, Sir: you may perhaps wish to go out, as we say in the West, in
coy.&mdash;happy to receive your commands at any time, prompt attention and
dispatch."
</p>
<p>
"Zounds! you are clipping the wig too close," said Tom, impatient to hear
the story, "and if you go on at this rate, you won't leave us even the
<i>tail</i> (tale)."
</p>
<p>
"Right, Sir, I take&mdash;'and thereby hangs a tale.' The observation is
in point, <i>verbum sat</i>, as the latinist would say. Well, Sir, as I was
saying, a citizen, with a design to outdo his neighbours, called at
one of the first shops in London a very short time since, and gave
particular orders to have his <i>pericranium</i> fitted with a wig of the
true royal cut. The dimensions of his upper story were taken&mdash;the order
executed to the very letter of the instructions&mdash;it fitted like wax&mdash;it
was nature&mdash;nay it soared beyond nature&mdash;it was the perfection of
art&mdash;the very acmé of science! Conception was outdone, and there is no
power in language to describe it. He was delighted; his wife was charmed
with the idea of a new husband, and he with his new wig; but
</p>
<pre>
     "Now comes the pleasant joke of all,
     'Tis when too close attack'd we fall."
</pre>
<p>
The account was produced&mdash;-would you believe it, he refused to have
it&mdash;he objected to the price."
</p>
<p>
"The devil take it!" said Tom, "object to pay for the acme of
perfection; this unnaturally natural wig would have fetched any money
among the collectors of curiosities."
</p>
<p>
"What was the price?" enquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Trifling, Sir, very trifling, to an artist 'of the first water,' as a
jeweller would say by his diamonds&mdash;only thirty guineas!!!"
</p>
<p>
"Thirty guineas!" exclaimed Bob, starting from his seat, and almost
overturning the <i>modernizer</i> of his head.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>Then, recollecting Sparkle's account of Living in Style, and Good
Breeding, falling gently into his seat again.
</p>
<p>
"Did I hurt you, Sir?" exclaimed the Peruquier.
</p>
<p>
Dashall bit his lip, and smiled at the surprise of his Cousin, which was
now so visibly depicted in his countenance.
</p>
<p>
"Not at all," replied Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"In two minutes more, Sir, your head will be a grace to; Bond Street or
St. James's; it cuts well, and looks well; and if you will allow me to
attend you once a month, it will continue so."
</p>
<p>
Tom hummed a tune, and looked out of the window; the other two were
silent till Bob was released. Tom <i>tip'd the blunt</i>, and the interesting
young man made his congé, and departed.
</p>
<p>
"A very interesting and amusing sort of person," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied Tom, "he is a walking volume of information: he knows
something of every thing, and almost of every body. He has been in
better circumstances, and seen a great deal of life; his history is
somewhat remarkable, and some particulars, not generally known, have
excited a considerable portion of interest in his fate among those
who are acquainted with them. He is the son, before marriage, of
a respectable and worthy tradesman, a celebrated vender of bear's

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>resided in the vicinity of Cornhill, and was for many years brought
up under his roof as his nephew; in which situation, the elegance of his
person, the vivacity of his disposition, and the general information he
acquired, became subjects of attraction. His education was respectable
for his situation, and his allowance liberal. His father however
marrying a young lady of some property, and he, 'gay, light, and airy,'
falling into bad hands, found his finances not sufficient to support
the company he kept, and by these means involved himself in pecuniary
difficulties, which, however, (if report say true) were more than once
or twice averted by the indulgent parent. In the course of time, the
family was increased by two sons, but he continued the flower of the
flock. At length it was intended by his father to retire, in part, from
business, and leave its management to this young man, and another who
had been many years in his service, and whose successful endeavours in
promoting his interest were well deserving his consideration; and the
writings for this purpose were actually drawn up. Previous however
to their execution, he was dispatched to Edinburgh, to superintend an
extensive concern of his father's in that city, where, meeting with
an amiable young lady with some expectations, he married without the
consent of his parent, a circumstance which drew down upon him the good
man's displeasure.
</p>
<p>
"Not at all dismayed at this, he almost immediately left his father's
shop, and set up business for himself in the same neighbourhood, where
he continued for two or three years, living, as it was supposed, upon
the produce of his matrimonial connexion. At length, however, it was
discovered that he was insolvent, and bankruptcy became the consequence.
Here he remained till affairs were arranged, and then returned to London
with his wife and two children.
</p>
<p>
"In the mean time, the legitimate family of his father had become useful
in the business, and acquainted with his former indiscretions, which,
consequently, were not likely to be obliterated from the old gentleman's
recollection. Without money and without prospect, he arrived in London,
where, for some unliquidated debt, he was arrested and became a resident
in the King's Bench, from which he was liberated by the Insolvent
Debtor's Act. Emancipated from this, he took small shops, or rather
rooms, in various parts of the city, vainly endeavouring to <span class="pagenum">[58]</span>support
the character he had formerly maintained. These however proved abortive.
Appeals to his father were found fruitless, and he has consequently,
after a series of vicissitudes, been compelled to act as a journeyman.
</p>
<p>
In the career of his youth, he distinguished himself as a dashing,
high-spirited fellow. He was selected as fuegel man to a regiment of
Volunteers, and made himself conspicuous at the celebrated O. P. row, at
the opening of Covent Garden Theatre, on which occasion he attracted the
notice of the Caricaturists,{1} and was generally known in the circles
of High Life, by his attendance on the first families on behalf of his
father.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps the most remarkable circumstance took place at his deceased
parent's funeral. Being so reduced at that time as to have no power even
of providing the necessary apparel to manifest the respect, gratitude,
and affection, he had ever entertained for the author of his being;
and as a natural son has no legal claims upon his father, so naturally
nothing was left for him; he applied by letter to the legitimates for a
suit of mourning, and permission to attend the remains of their common
father to the last receptacle of mortality, which being peremptorily
refused, he raised a subscription, obtained clothing, with a gown and
hatband, and, as the melancholy procession was moving to the parish
church, which was but a few yards distance, he rushed from his
hiding-place, stationed himself immediately in the front of the other
attendants upon the occasion, and actually accompanied the corpse as
chief mourner, having previously concerted with his own mother to be
upon the spot. When the body was deposited in the vault, he took her
by the hand, led her down the steps, and gave some directions to the
bearers as to the situation of the coffin, while the other mourners,
panic-struck at the extraordinary circumstances in which they found
themselves, turned about and walked in mournful silence back, ruminating
on the past with amazement, and full of conjecture for the future.
</p>
<pre>
     1 A caricature of a similar nature to the one alluded to by
     Dashall in this description, was certainly exhibited at the
     time of the memorable 0. P. row, which exhibited a young man
     of genteel appearance in the pit of Covent Garden Theatre,
     addressing the audience.    It had inscribed at the bottom
     of it,

          Is this Barber-Ross-a?

     in allusion (no doubt) to the tragedy of Barbarossa.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>"It was an extraordinary situation for all parties," said Bob; "but
hold, who have we here?&mdash;Egad! there is an elegant carriage drawn up to
the door; some Lord, or Nobleman, I'll be bound for it&mdash;We can't be seen
in this deshabille, I shall make my escape." And saying this, he was
hastening out of the room.
</p>
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" exclaimed Tom, "you need not be so speedy in your flight.
This is one of the fashionable requisites of London, with whom you
must also become acquainted; there is no such thing as doing without
them&mdash;dress and address are indispensables. This is no other than one of
the decorators."
</p>
<p>
"Decorators!" continued Bob, not exactly comprehending him.
</p>
<p>
"Monsieur le Tailleur&mdash;'Tin Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, from Cork Street, come to
exhibit his Spring patterns, and turn us out with the new cut&mdash;so pray
remain where you are."
</p>
<p>
"Tailor&mdash;decorator," said Bob&mdash;"Egad! the idea is almost as ridiculous
as the representation of the taylor riding to Brentford."
</p>
<p>
By this time the door was opened, and Mr. W. entered, making his bow
with the precision of a dancing-master, and was followed by a servant
with pattern-books, the other apparatus of his trade. The first
salutations over, large pattern-books were displayed upon the table,
exhibiting to view a variety of fancy-coloured cloths, and measures
taken accordingly. During which time, Tom, as on the former occasion,
continued his enquiries relative to the occurrences in the fashionable
world.
</p>
<p>
"Rather tame, Sir, at present: the Queen's unexpected visit to the two
theatres was for a time a matter of surprise&mdash;the backwardness of Drury
Lane managers to produce 'God Save the King,' has been construed into
disloyalty to the Sovereign&mdash;and a laughable circumstance took place on
his going to the same house a few nights back, which has already been
made the subject of much merriment, both in conversation and caricature.
It appears that Mr. Gloss'em, who is a <i>shining character</i> in the
theatrical world, at least among the minors of the metropolis; and whose
father was for many years a wax-chandler in the neighbourhood of Soho,
holds a situation as clerk of the cheque to the Gentlemen Pensioners
of his Majesty's household, as well as that of Major Domo, manager and
proprietor of a certain theatre, not half a mile from Waterloo Bridge.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>A part of his duty in the former capacity is to attend occasionally
upon the person of the King, as one of the appendages of Royalty; in
which <i>character</i> he appeared on the night in question. The servants
of the attendants who were in waiting for their masters, had a room
appropriated to their use. One of these latter gentry, no other than
Gloss'em's servant, being anxious to have as near a view of the sacred
person of his Majesty as his employer, had placed himself in a good
situation at the door, in order to witness his departure, when a Mr.
Winpebble, of mismanaging notoriety, and also a ponderous puff, assuming
managerial authority, espying him, desired the police-officers and
guards in attendance to turn out the lamp-lighter's boy, pointing to
Gloss'em's servant. This, it seems, was no sooner said than done, at the
point of the bayonet. Some little scuffle ensued&mdash;His Majesty and suite
departed&mdash;Hold up your arm, Sir."
</p>
<p>
"But did the matter end there?" enquired Dashall.
</p>
<p>
"O dear, no&mdash;not exactly."
</p>
<p>
"Because if it did," continued Tom, "in my opinion, it began with a wax
taper, and ended in the smoke of a farthing rushlight. You have made it
appear to be a gas-receiver without supplies."
</p>
<p>
"I beg pardon," said Mr. W.; "the pipes are full, but the gas is not yet
turned on."
</p>
<p>
This created a laugh, and Mr. W. proceeded:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The next day, the servant having informed his Master of the treatment
he had received, a gentleman was dispatched from Gloss'em to Winpebble,
to demand an apology: which being refused, the former, with a large
horsewhip under his arm, accosted the latter, and handsomely belaboured
his shoulders with lusty stripes. That, you see, Sir, sets the gas all
in a blaze.&mdash;That will do, Sir.&mdash;Now, Sir, at your service," addressing
himself to Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Tom, "the taper's alight again now; and pray what was the
consequence?"
</p>
<p>
"Winpebble called for assistance, which was soon obtained, and away they
went to Bow-street. Manager Taper, and Manager Vapour&mdash;the one blazing
with fire, and the other exhausted with thrashing;&mdash;'twas a laughing
scene. Manager Strutt, and Manager Butt, were strutting and butting
each other. The magistrate heard the case, and recommended peace and
quietness between <span class="pagenum">[61]</span>them, by an amicable adjustment. The irritated
minds of the now two enraged managers could not be brought to consent
to this. Gloss'em declared the piece should be repeated, having been
received with the most rapturous applause. Winpebble roundly swore that
the piece was ill got up, badly represented, and damn'd to all intents
and purposes&mdash;that the author had more strength than wit&mdash;and though
not a friend to injunctions himself, he moved for an injunction against
Gloss'em; who was at length something like the renowned John Astley with
his imitator Rees:
</p>
<p>
"This great John Astley, and this little Tommy Rees, Were both bound
over to keep the King's Peas."
</p>
<p>
Gloss'em was bound to keep the peace, and compelled to find security
in the sum of twenty pounds. Thus ended the farce of <i>The Enraged
Managers&mdash;Drury Lane in a Blaze, or Bow Street bewildered.</i>"
</p>
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha! an animated sort of vehicle for public amusement truly,"
said Tom, "and of course produced with new scenery, music, dresses, and
decorations; forming a combination of attractions superior to any ever
exhibited at any theatre&mdash;egad! it would make a most excellent scene in
a new pantomime."
</p>
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" said Mr. W. "true, Sir, true; and the duel of Lord
Shampetre would have also its due portion of effect; but as his
Lordship is a good customer of mine, you must excuse any remarks on that
circumstance."
</p>
<p>
"We have already heard of his Lordship's undaunted courage and firmness,
as well as the correctness of his aim."
</p>
<p>
"He! he! he!" chuckled W.; "then I fancy your information is not very
correct, for it appears his lordship displayed a want of every one of
those qualities that you impute to him; however, I venture to hope no
unpleasant measures will result from the occurrence, as I made the very
pantaloons he wore upon the occasion. It seems he is considerably <i>cut
up</i>; but you must know that, previous to the duel, I was consulted
upon the best mode of securing his sacred person from the effects of a
bullet: I recommended a very high waistband lined with whale-bone, and
well padded with horse-hair, to serve as a breast-plate, and calculated
at once to produce warmth, and resist <span class="pagenum">[62]</span>penetration. The pantaloons
were accordingly made, thickly overlaid with extremely rich and
expensive gold lace, and considered to be stiff enough for any
thing&mdash;aye, even to keep his Lordship erect. But what do you suppose was
the effect of all my care? I should not like to make a common talk
of it, but so it certainly was: his Lordship had no objection to the
whalebone, buckram, &amp;c. outside of him, but was fearful that if his
antagonist's fire should be well-directed, his tender body might be
additionally hurt by the splinters of the whalebone being carried along
with it, and actually proposed to take them off before the dreadful hour
of appointment came on. In this however he was fortunately overruled by
his Second, who, by the by, was but a goose in the affair, and managed
it altogether very badly, except in the instance of being prompt with
the smelling-bottle, which certainly was well-timed; and it would have
been a hissing hot business, but for the judicious interference of the
other Second."
</p>
<p>
A loud laugh succeeded this additional piece of information relative
to the <i>affair of honour</i>; and Snip having finished his measurement,
colours were fixed upon, and he departed, promising to be punctual in
the delivery of the new habiliments on the next day.
</p>
<p>
"I am now convinced," said Bob, "of the great importance and utility of
a London tradesman, and the speed of their execution is wonderful!"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied Tom, "it is only to be equalled by the avidity with which
they obtain information, and the rapidity with which they circulate
it&mdash;why, in another half hour your personal appearance, the cut of
your country coat, your complexion and character, as far as so short
an interview would allow for obtaining it, will be known to all his
customers&mdash;they are generally quick and acute discerners. But come,
we must be making ready for our walk, it is now half-past ten
o'clock&mdash;Sparkle will be here presently. It is time to be dressing, as I
mean to have a complete ramble during the day, take a chop somewhere
on the road, and in the evening, my boy, we'll take a peep into the
theatre. Lord Byron's tragedy of Marino Faliero is to be performed
to-night, and I can, I think, promise you a treat of the highest kind."
</p>
<p>
Tallyho, who had no idea of dressing again, having already been obliged
to dress twice, seemed a little surprised at the proposition, but
supposing it to be the <span class="pagenum">[63]</span>custom of London, nodded assent, and
proceeded to the dressing-room. As he walked up stairs he could not help
casting his visual orbs over the banisters, just to take a bird's eye
view of the scene of his morning disasters, of which, to his great
astonishment and surprise, not a vestige remained&mdash;a new lamp had been
procured, which seemed to have arisen like a phoenix from its ashes, and
the stone passage and stairs appeared as he termed it, "as white as a
cauliflower." At the sight of all this, he was gratified and delighted,
for he expected to find a heap of ruins to reproach him. He skipped, or
rather vaulted up the stairs, three or four at a stride, with all the
gaiety of a race-horse when first brought to the starting-post. The
rapid movements of a Life in London at once astonished and enraptured
him; nor did he delay his steps, or his delight, until he had reached
the topmost story, when bursting open the door, lie marched boldly into
the room. Here again he was at fault; a female shriek assailed his ear,
which stopped his course, and looking around him, he could not find from
whence the voice proceeded. "Good God!" continued the same voice, "what
can be the meaning of this intrusion?&mdash;Begone, rash man." In the mean
time, Tom, who was in a room just under the one into which he had
unfortunately made so sudden an entrance, appeared at the door.
</p>
<p>
"What the devil is the matter now?" said Tom; when spying his cousin
in the centre of the room, without seeming to know whether to return or
remain, he could not restrain his laughter. Tallyho looked up, like one
in a dream&mdash;then down&mdash;then casting his eyes around him, he perceived
in the corner, peeping out from the bed-curtains in which she had
endeavoured to hide her almost naked person, the head of the old
Housekeeper. The picture was moving, and at the same time laughable.
The confusion of Bob&mdash;the fright of the Housekeeper, and the laughter of
Tom, were subjects for the pencil of a Hogarth!
</p>
<p>
"So," said Tom, "you are for springing game in all parts of the house,
and at all times too. How came you here?"&mdash;"Not by my appointment, Sir,"
replied the old lady, who still remained rolled up in the curtain. "I
never did such a thing in all my born days: I'm an honest woman, and
mean to remain so. I never was so ashamed in all my life."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>"I believe the house is enchanted," cried Bob; "d&mdash;&mdash; me, I never
seem to step without being on a barrel of gunpowder, ready to ignite
with the touch of my foot. I have made some cursed blunder again, and
don't seem to know where I am."
</p>
<p>
"Come, come," said Dashall, "that won't do&mdash;I'm sure you had some design
upon my Housekeeper, who you hear by her own account is a good woman,
and won't listen to your advances."
</p>
<p>
By this time the servants had arrived at the door, and were alternately
peeping in, wondering to see the two gentlemen in such a situation, and
secretly giggling and enjoying the embarrassment of the old woman,
whose wig lay on the table, and who was displaying her bald pate and
shrivelled features from the bed-curtains, enveloped in fringe and
tassels, which only served to render them still more ludicrous.
</p>
<p>
Bob affected to laugh; said it was very odd&mdash;he could not account for
it at all&mdash;stammered out something like an apology&mdash;begg'd pardon&mdash;it
was&mdash;a mistake&mdash;he really took it for his own room&mdash;he never was
so bewildered in his life&mdash;was very sorry he should cause so much
alarm&mdash;but really had no sort of intention whatever.
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Dashall, "the best reparation you can now make for your
intrusion is a speedy retreat. Time is escaping, so come along;" and
taking him by the arm, they walked down the stairs together, and then
proceeded to re-fit without further obstruction, in order to be ready
for Sparkle, who was expected every minute.
</p>
<p>
The first day of Bob's residence in London had already been productive
of some curious adventures, in which he, unfortunately as he considered,
had sustained the principal character&mdash;a character not altogether
suitable to is inclinations or wishes, though productive of much
merriment to his ever gay and sprightly Cousin, who had witnessed the
embarrassment of his pupil upon his first entrance into Life with
ungovernable laughter. It was to him excellent sport, while it furnished
a good subject of speculation and conversation among the servants below,
but was not so well relished by the affrighted old house-keeper. Indeed,
the abrupt entrance of a man into her bed-chamber had so deranged her
ideas, that she was longer than usual in decking her person previous to
her <span class="pagenum">[65]</span>re-appearance. The tender frame of the old lady had been
subjected to serious agitations at the bare idea of such a visit, and
the probable imputations that might in consequence be thrown upon her
sacred and unspotted character; nor could she for some time recover her
usual serenity.
</p>
<p>
Such was the situation of the parties at the moment we are now
describing; but as our Heroes are preparing for an extensive, actual
survey of men, manners, and tilings, we shall for the present leave them
in peace and quietness, while we proceed to the next chapter.

<h2>
    CHAPTER VII
</h2>
<pre>
          What shows! and what sights! what a round of delights
          You'll meet in the gay scene of London;
          How charming to view" amusements still new,
          Twenty others you'll find soon as one's done.
          At the gay scene at Court&mdash;Peers and gentry resort,
          In pleasure you'll never miss one day:
          There's the Opera treat, the parade in Bond Street,
          And the crowd in Hyde Park on a Sunday.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>TOM, whose wardrobe was extensive, found no difficulty, and lost no
time in preparing for the promenade; while, on the other hand, Tallyho
was perplexed to know how to tog himself out in a way suitable to
make his appearance in the gay world of fashion. Dashall had therefore
rapidly equipped himself, when, perceiving it was half-past eleven,
he was the more perplexed to account for the absence of Sparkle; for
although it was an early hour, yet, upon such an occasion as that of
initiating a new recruit, it was very extraordinary that he should not
have been prompt. However, he entered Tallyho's room, and found him
looking out of the window in a posture of rumination, probably revolving
in his mind the events of the morning.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said Tom, as he entered, "'tis time to be on the move, and if
Sparkle don't show in a few minutes, we'll set sail and call in upon him
at Long's, in Bond Street. Perhaps he is not well, or something prevents
his appearance&mdash;we'll make it in our way, and we have a fine day before
us."
</p>
<p>
"I am at your service," replied Bob, who could not help viewing the
elegance of his Cousin's appearance: the style of his dress, and the
neatness with which his garments fitted him, were all subjects of
admiration, and formed so strong a contrast with his own as almost
to excite envy. He had however attired himself in a way that befits a
fashionable country gentleman: a green coat, white waistcoat, buckskin
breeches, and boots, over <span class="pagenum">[67]</span>which a pair of leggings appeared, which
extended below the calf of the leg and half up the thigh, surmounted
with a <i>Lily Shallow</i>. Such was the costume in which he was destined to
show off; and thus equipped, after a few minutes they emerged from the
house in Piccadilly on the proposed ramble, and proceeded towards Bond
Street.
</p>
<p>
The first object that took their particular attention was the Burlington
Arcade. "Come," said Tom, "we may as well go this way," and immediately
they passed the man in the gold-laced hat, who guards the entrance to
prevent the admission of boys and improper persons. The display of the
shops, with the sun shining through the windows above, afforded much for
observation, and attracted Bob from side to side&mdash;to look, to wonder and
admire. But Tom, who was intent upon finding his friend Sparkle, urged
the necessity of moving onward with more celerity, lest he should be
gone out, and consequently kept drawing his Cousin forward. "Another and
a better opportunity will be afforded for explanation than the present,
and as speed is the order of the day, I hope you will not prove
disorderly; we shall soon reach Long's, and when we have Sparkle with
us, we have one of the most intelligent and entertaining fellows in
the world. He is a sort of index to every thing, and every body; his
knowledge of life and character, together with a facetiousness of
whim and manner, which he has in delineating them, are what we call
in London&mdash;<i>Prime and bang up to the mark</i>. There is scarcely a Lane,
Court, Alley, or Street, in the Metropolis, but what he knows, from the
remotest corners of Rag-Fair, to the open and elegant Squares of the
West, even to Hyde Park Corner. Memory, mirth, and magic, seem at all
times to animate his tongue, and, as the Song says,
</p>
<pre>
          "He is the hoy for bewitching 'em,
          Whether good-humour'd or coy."
</pre>
<p>
Indeed, he is the admiration of all who know him; wit, whim, frolic,
and fun, are constant companions with him, and I really believe, in a
dungeon or a palace, he would always appear the same."
</p>
<p>
By this time they had reached Bond Street, in their way to which,
each step they had taken, the streets and avenues of every description
appeared to Bob to be crowded to an excess; the mingling cries which
were <span class="pagenum">[68]</span>vociferated around them produced in his mind uncommon
sensations. The rattling of the carriages, the brilliance of the shops,
and the continual hum of the passengers, contributed to heighten the
scene.
</p>
<p>
"Bond Street," said Dashall, "is not one of the most elegant streets
in the vicinity of London, but is the resort of the most fashionable
people, and from about two o'clock till five, it is all bustle&mdash;all
life&mdash;every species of fashionable vehicle is to be seen dashing
along in gay and gallant pride. From two to five are the fashionable
shopping-hours, for which purpose the first families resort to this
well-known street&mdash;others, to shew their equipage, make an assignation,
or kill a little time; which is as much a business with some, as is the
more careful endeavours of others to seize him in his flight, and make
the most of his presence. The throng is already increasing; the variety,
richness, and gaiety of the shops in this street, will always be
attractive, and make it a popular rendezvous of both sexes. It will
shortly be as crowded as Rag Fair, or the Royal Exchange; and the magic
splendour has very peculiar properties.
</p>
<p>
"It makes the tradesman forget&mdash;while he is cheating a lovely and
smiling Duchess&mdash;that in all probability her ladyship is endeavouring to
cheat him. It makes the gay and airy, the furbelowed and painted lady of
the town, forget that she must pay a visit to her uncle,{1} in order
to raise the wind before she can make her appearance at the theatre
at half-price. It makes the dashing prisoner forget, that while "he
is sporting his figure in the bang-up style of appearance, he is only
taking his ride on a day-rule from the King's Bench. It makes the Lord
who drives four-in-hand forget his losses of the night before at some of
the fashionable gaming-houses. It makes one adventurer forget that the
clothes in which he expects to obtain respect and attention, are more
than likely to be paid for in Newgate; another for a time forgets that
<i>John Doe</i> and <i>Richard Roe</i> have expelled him from his
</p>
<pre>
     1 My Uncle is a very convenient and accommodating sort of
     friend, who lives at the sign of the Three Balls, indicative
     of his willingness to lend money upon good security, for the
     payment of enormous interest. The original meaning of the
     sign has puzzled the curious and antiquarians, and the only
     probable meaning they can discover is, that it implies the
     chances are two to one against any property being redeemed
     after being once committed to the keeping of this tender
     hearted and affectionate relative.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>lodgings; and a third that all his worldly possessions are not equal
to the purchase of a dinner. It is an <i>ignis fatuus</i>&mdash;a sort of magic
lantern replete with delusive appearances&mdash;of momentary duration&mdash;an
escape to the regions of noise, tumult, vanity, and frivolity, where the
realities of Life, the circumstances and the situation of the observer,
are not suffered to intrude.
</p>
<p>
"But to be seen in this street at a certain hour, is one of the
essentials to the existence of <i>haut-ton</i>&mdash;it is the point of attraction
for greetings in splendid equipages, from the haughty bend or familiar
nod of arrogance, to the humble bow of servility. Here mimicry without
money assumes the consequential air of independence: while modest merit
creeps along unheeded through the glittering crowd. Here all the senses
are tantalized with profusion, and the eye is dazzled with temptation,
for no other reason than because it is the constant business of a
fashionable life&mdash;not to live in, but out of self, to imitate the
luxuries of the affluent without a tithe of their income, and to
sacrifice morality at the altar of notoriety."
</p>
<p>
"Your description of this celebrated street, of which I have heard so
much," said Tallyho, "is truly lively."
</p>
<p>
"But it is strictly true," continued Tom.
</p>
<p>
They had now arrived at Long's, and found a barouche and four waiting at
the door. Upon entering, the first person they met was Lord Cripplegate,
whom they passed, and proceeded to the coffee-room; in one of the
boxes of which Tom immediately directed his Cousin's attention to a
well-dressed young man, who was reading the newspaper, and sipping his
coffee&mdash;"Take notice of him," said Tom.
</p>
<p>
Bob looked at him for a moment, marked his features, and his dress,
which was in the extreme of fashion; while Tom, turning to one of the
Waiters, enquired for his friend Sparkle.
</p>
<p>
"He has not been here since yesterday morning!" said the Waiter.
</p>
<p>
"I have been waiting for him these two hours!" exclaimed the young Sprig
of Fashion, laying down the newspaper almost at the same moment, "and
must wait till he comes&mdash;Ah! Mr. Dashall, how d'ye do?&mdash;-very glad to
see you&mdash;left all well in the country, I hope!&mdash;Mr. Sparkle was to have
met me this morning at eleven precisely, I should judge he is gone into
the country."
</p>
<p>
"It must have been late last night, then," said Dashall, <span class="pagenum">[70]</span>"for he
left us about half-past ten, and promised also to meet us again this
morning at eleven; I can't think what can have become of him&mdash;but come,"
said he, taking Bob by the arm, "we must keep moving&mdash;Good morning&mdash;good
morning." And thus saying, walked directly out of the house, turning to
the right again towards Piccadilly.
</p>
<p>
"There is a remark made, I think by Goldsmith," said Tom, "that one half
of the world don't know how the other half lives; and the man I spoke to
in the coffee-room, whose name I am unacquainted with, though his person
is recognized by almost every body, while his true character, residence,
and means of subsistence, remain completely in obscurity, from what I
have seen of him, I judge is what may be termed a <i>hanger on</i>."
</p>
<p>
"A hanger on," said Bob&mdash;"what can that mean? I took him for a man of
property and high birth&mdash;but I saw you take so little notice of him."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! my good fellow, I have already cautioned you not to be duped by
appearances. A <i>hanger on</i> is a sort of sycophant, or toad-eater,
and, in the coffee-houses and hotels of London, many such are to be
found&mdash;men who can <i>spin out a long yarn</i>, tell a tough story, and
tip you <i>a rum chant</i>&mdash;who invite themselves by a freedom of address
bordering on impudence to the tables and the parties of persons they
know, by pretending to call in by mere accident, just at the appointed
time: by assuming great confidence, great haste, little appetite, and
much business; but, at the same time, requiring but little pressure to
forego them all for the pleasure of the company present. What he
can have to do with Sparkle I am at a loss to conceive; but he is an
insinuating and an intriguing sort of fellow, whom I by no means like,
so I cut him."
</p>
<p>
Bob did not exactly understand the meaning of the word cut, and
therefore begged his Cousin to explain.
</p>
<p>
"The cut," said Tom, "is a fashionable word for getting rid, by rude
or any means, of any person whose company is not agreeable. The art of
<i>cutting</i> is reduced to a system in London; and an explanatory treatise
has been written on the subject for the edification of the natives.{1}
But I am so bewildered to think what can have detained Sparkle, and
deprived us of his company, that I scarcely know how to think for a
moment on any other subject at present."
</p>
<pre>
     1 Vide a small volume entitled "The Cutter."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>"It is somewhat strange!" cried Bob, "that he was not with you this
morning."
</p>
<p>
"There is some mystery in it," said Tom, "which time alone can unravel;
but however, we will not be deprived of our intended ramble." At this
moment they entered Piccadilly, and were crossing the road in their way
to St. James's Street, when Dashall nodded to a gentleman passing by on
the opposite side, and received a sort of half bow in return. "That,"
said Tom, "is a curious fellow, and a devilish clever fellow too&mdash;for
although he has but one arm, he is a man of science."
</p>
<p>
"In what way?" enquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"He is a pugilist," said Tom&mdash;"one of those courageous gentlemen who can
queer the daylights, tap the claret, prevent telling fibs, and pop the
noddle into chancery; and a devilish good hand he is, I can assure you,
among those who
</p>
<pre>
     &mdash;&mdash;"can combat with ferocious strife,
     And beat an eye out, or thump out a life;
     Can bang the ribs in, or bruise out the brains,
     And die, like noble blockheads, for their pains."

<p>
"Having but one arm, of course he is unable to figure in the
ring&mdash;though he attends the mills, and is a constant visitor at the
Fives Court exhibitions, and generally appears <i>a la Belcher</i>. He prides
himself upon flooring a novice, and hits devilish hard with the glove. I
have had some lessons from this amateur of the old English science, and
felt the force of his fist; but it is a very customary thing to commence
in a friendly way, till the knowing one finds an opportunity which he
cannot resist, of shewing the superiority he possesses. So it was with
Harry and me, when he put on his glove. I use the singular number,
because he has but one hand whereon to place a glove withal. Come, said
he, it shall only be a little innocent spar. I also put on a glove,
for it would not be fair to attack a one-armed man with two, and no one
ought to take the odds in combat. To it we went, and I shewed <i>first
blood</i>, for he tapped <i>the claret</i> in no time.
</p>
<p>
"Neat <i>milling we had</i>, what with <i>clouts on the nob</i>, Home hits in
the <i>bread-basket</i>, clicks in the gob, And plumps in the daylights, a
prettier treat Between two <i>Johnny Raws</i> 'tis not easy to meet."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>"I profited however by Harry's lessons, and after a short time was
enabled to return the compliment with interest, by sewing up one of his
<i>glimmers</i>.
</p>
<p>
"This is St. James's Street," continued he, as they turned the corner
rather short; in doing which, somewhat animated by the description he
had just been giving, Tom's foot caught the toe of a gentleman, who
was mincing along the pathway with all the care and precision of a
dancing-master, which had the effect of bringing him to the ground in an
instant as effectually as a blow from one of the fancy. Tom, who had
no intention of giving offence wantonly, apologized for the misfortune,
by&mdash;"I beg pardon, Sir," while Bob, who perceived the poor creature was
unable to rise again, and apprehending some broken bones, assisted him
to regain his erect position. The poor animal, or nondescript, yclept
Dandy, however had only been prevented the exercise of its limbs by the
stiffness of certain appendages, without which its person could not be
complete&mdash;the <i>stays</i>, lined with whalebone, were the obstacles to its
rising. Being however placed in its natural position, he began in an
affected blustering tone of voice to complain that it was d&mdash;&mdash;d odd
a gentleman could not walk along the streets without being incommoded
by puppies&mdash;pulled out his quizzing glass, and surveyed our heroes from
head to foot&mdash;then taking from his pocket a smelling bottle, which, by
application to the nose, appeared to revive him, Tom declared he was
sorry for the accident, had no intention, and hoped he was not hurt.
This, however, did not appear to satisfy the offended Dandy, who turned
upon his heel muttering to himself the necessity there was of preventing
drunken fellows from rambling the streets to the annoyance of sober and
genteel people in the day-time.
</p>
<p>
Dashall, who overheard the substance of his ejaculation, broke from the
arm of Bob, and stepping after him without ceremony, by a sudden wheel
placed himself in the front of him, so as to impede his progress a
second time; a circumstance which filled Mr. Fribble with additional
alarm, and his agitation became visibly' depicted on his countenance.
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean?" cried Dashall, with indignation, taking the
imputation of drunkenness at that early hour in dudgeon. "Who, and
what are you, <span class="pagenum">[73]</span>Sir?{1} Explain instantly, or by the honour of a
gentleman, I'll chastise this insolence."
</p>
<pre>
     1 "What are you?" is a formidable question to a dandy of the
     present day, for

          "Dandy's a gender of the doubtful kind;
          A something, nothing, not to be defined;
          'Twould puzzle worlds its sex to ascertain,
          So very empty, and so very vain."

     It is a fact that the following examination of three of
     these non-descripts took place at Bow Street a very short
     time back, in consequence of a nocturnal fracas. The report
     was thus given:

     "Three young sprigs of fashion, in full dress, somewhat
     damaged and discoloured by a night's lodging in the cell of
     a watch-house, were yesterday brought before Mr. Birnie,
     charged with disorderly conduct in the streets, and with
     beating a watchman named Lloyd.

     "Lloyd stated that his beat was near the Piazza, and at a
     very late hour on Thursday night, the three defendants came
     through Covent Garden, singing, and conducting themselves in
     the most riotous manner possible. They were running, and
     were followed by three others, all in a most uproarious
     state of intoxication, and he thought proper to stop them;
     upon which he was <i>floored san-ceremonie</i>, and when he
     recovered his legs, he was again struck, and called '<i>a b&mdash;&mdash;y
     Charley</i>,' and other ungenteel names.    He called for
     the assistance of some of his brethren, and the defendants
     were with some trouble taken to the watch-house. They were
     very jolly on the way, and when lodged in durance, amused
     themselves with abusing the Constable of the night, and took
     especial care that no one within hearing of the watch-house
     should get a wink of sleep for the remainder of the night.

     Mr. Birnie.&mdash;"Well young gentleman, what have you to say to
     this?" The one who undertook to be spokesman, threw himself
     in the most familiar manner possible across the table, and
     having fixed himself perfectly at his ease, he said, "The
     fact was, they had been dining at a tavern, and were rather
     drunk, and on their way through the Piazza, they endeavoured
     by running away to give the slip to their three companions,
     who were still worse than themselves. The others, however
     called out Stop thief! and the watchman stopped them;
     whereat they naturally felt irritated, and certainly gave
     the watchman a bit of a thrashing."

     Mr. Birnie.&mdash;"How was he to know you were not the thieves?
     He did quite right to stop you, and I am very glad he has
     brought you here&mdash;Pray, Sir, what are you?" Defendant.&mdash;"I
     am nothing, Sir." Mr. Birnie (to another).&mdash;"And what are
     you?" Defendant.&mdash;"Why, Sir, I am&mdash;I am, Sir, nothing." Mr.
     Birnie.&mdash;"Well, this is very fine.   Pray, Sir, (turning to
     the third, who stood twirling his hat) will you do me the
     favour to tell what you are?"

     This gentleman answered in the same way. "I am, as my
     friends observed, nothing."

     Mr. Birnie.&mdash;"Well, gentlemen, I must endeavour to make
     something of you. Here, gaoler, let them he locked up, and I
     shall not part with them until I have some better account of
     their occupations."

     We have heard it asserted, that Nine tailors make a man. How
     many Dandies, professing to be Nothing, may be required to
     accomplish the proposed intention of making Something, may
     (perhaps by this time) be discovered by the worthy
     Magistrate. We however suspect he has had severe work of it.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>"Leave me alone," exclaimed the almost petrified Dandy.
</p>
<p>
"Not till you have given me the satisfaction I have a right to demand,"
cried Tom. "I insist upon an explanation and apology&mdash;or demand your
card&mdash;who are you, Sir? That's my address," instantly handing him a
card. "I am not to be played with, nor will I suffer your escape, after
the insulting manner in which you have spoken, with impunity."
</p>
<p>
Though not prepared for such a rencontre, the Dandy, who now perceived
the inflexible temper of Tom's mind&mdash;and a crowd of people gathering
round him&mdash;determined at least to put on as much of the character of a
man as possible, and fumbled in his pocket for a card; at length finding
one, he slipped it into Tom's hand. "Oh, Sir," said he, "if that's the
case, I'm your man, <i>demmee</i>,&mdash;how, when, or where you please, 'pon
honor." Then beckoning to a hackney coach, he hobbled to the door,
and was pushed in by coachee, who, immediately mounted the box and
flourishing his whip, soon rescued him from his perilous situation, and
the jeers of the surrounding multitude.
</p>
<p>
Tom, who in the bustle of the crowd had slipped the card of his
antagonist into his pocket, now took Bob's arm, and they pursued their
way down St. James's Street, and could not help laughing at the affair:
but Tallyho, who had a great aversion to duelling, and was thinking of
the consequences, bit his lips, and expressed his sorrow at what
had occurred; he ascribed the hasty imputation of drunkenness to the
irritating effects of the poor creature's accident, and expressed his
hope that his cousin would take no further notice of it. Tom, however,
on the other <span class="pagenum">[75]</span>hand, ridiculed Bob's fears&mdash;told him it was a point
of honour not to suffer an insult in the street from any man&mdash;nor would
he&mdash;besides, the charge of drunkenness from such a thing as that, is not
to be borne. "D&mdash;&mdash;n it, man, drunkenness in the early part of the day
is a thing I abhor, it is at all times what I would avoid if possible,
but at night there may be many apologies for it; nay in some cases even
to avoid it is impossible. The pleasures of society are enhanced
by it&mdash;the joys of love are increased by the circulation of the
glass&mdash;harmony, conviviality and friendship are produced by it&mdash;though I
am no advocate for inebriety, and detest the idea of the beast&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Who clouds his reason by the light of day,
          And falls to drink, an early and an easy prey."
</pre>
<p>
"Well," said Bob, "I cannot help thinking this poor fellow, who has
already betrayed his fears, will be inclined to make any apology for his
rudeness to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
"If he does not," said Tom, "I'll wing him, to a certainty&mdash;a
jackanapes&mdash;a puppy&mdash;a man-milliner; perhaps a thing of shreds and
patches&mdash;he shall not go unpunished, I promise you; so come along, we
will just step in here, and I'll dispatch this business at once: I'll
write a challenge, and then it will be off my hands." And so saying,
they entered a Coffee-house, where, calling for pen, ink and paper, Tom
immediately began his epistle, shrewdly hinting to his Cousin, that he
expected he would act as his Second. "It will be a fine opportunity for
introducing your name to the gay world&mdash;the newspapers will record your
name as a man of ton. Let us see now how it will appear:&mdash;On &mdash;&mdash; last,
the Honourable Tom Dashall, attended by his Cousin, Robert Tallyho, Esq.
of Belleville Hall, met&mdash;ah, by the bye, let us see who he is," here he
felt in his pocket for the card.
</p>
<p>
Bob, however, declared his wish to decline obtaining popularity by being
present upon such an occasion, and suggested the idea of his calling
upon the offender, and endeavouring to effect an amicable arrangement
between them.
</p>
<p>
"Hallo!" exclaimed Tom with surprise, as he drew the card from his
pocket, and threw it on the table&mdash;"Ha, ha, ha,&mdash;look at that."
</p>
<p>
Tallyho looked at the card without understanding it. "What does it
mean?" said he.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>"Mean," replied Tom, "why it is a Pawnbroker's duplicate for a
Hunting Watch, deposited with his uncle this morning in St. Martin's
Lane, for two pounds&mdash;laughable enough&mdash;well, you may dismiss your fears
for the present; but I'll try if I can't find my man by this means&mdash;if
he is worth finding&mdash;at all events we have found a watch."
</p>
<p>
Bob now joined in the laugh, and, having satisfied the Waiter, they
sallied forth again.
</p>
<p>
Just as they left the Coffee-house, "Do you see that Gentleman in the
blue great coat, arm in arm with another? that is no other than the
&mdash;&mdash;. You would scarcely conceive, by his present appearance, that
he has commanded armies, and led them on to victory; and that having
retired under the shade of his laurels, he is withering them away,
leaf by leaf, by attendance at the <i>hells</i>{1} of the metropolis; his
unconquerable spirit still actuating him in his hours of relaxation. It
is said that the immense sum awarded to him for his prowess in war,
has been so materially reduced by his inordinate passion for play, that
although he appears at Court, and is a favourite, the demon Poverty
stares him in the face. But this is a vile world, and half one hears is
not to be believed. He is certainly extravagant, fond of women, and fond
of wine; but all these foibles are overshadowed with so much glory as
scarcely to remain perceptible. Here is the Palace," said Tom, directing
his Cousin's attention to the bottom of the street.
</p>
<p>
Bob was evidently struck at this piece of information, as he could
discover no mark of grandeur in its appearance to entitle it to the
dignity of a royal residence.
</p>
<p>
"It is true," said Tom, "the outside appearance is not much in its
favour; but it is venerable for its antiquity, and for its being till
lately the place at which the Kings of this happy Island have held their
Courts. On the site of that palace originally stood an hospital,
founded before the conquest, for fourteen leprous females, to whom eight
brethren were afterwards added, to assist in the performance of divine
service."
</p>
<p>
"Very necessary," said Bob, "and yet scarcely sufficient."
</p>
<pre>
     1 Hells&mdash;The abode or resort of black-legs or gamblers,
     where they assemble to commit their depredations on the
     unwary. But of these we shall have occasion to enlarge
     elsewhere.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>"You seem to quiz this Palace, and are inclined to indulge your wit
upon old age. In 1532, it was surrendered to Henry viii. and he erected
the present Palace, and enclosed St. James's Park, to serve as a place
of amusement and exercise, both to this Palace and Whitehall. But it
does not appear to have been the Court of the English Sovereigns, during
their residence in town, till the reign of Queen Ann, from which time it
has been uniformly used as such.
</p>
<p>
"It is built of brick; and that part which contains the state
apartments, being only one story high, gives it a regular appearance
outside. The State-rooms are commodious and handsome, although there is
nothing very superb or grand in the decorations or furniture.
</p>
<p>
"The entrance to these rooms is by a stair-case which opens into the
principal court, which you now see. At the top of the stair-case are
two rooms; one on the left, called the Queen's, and the other the King's
Guard-room, leading to the State-apartments. Immediately beyond the
King's Guard-room is the Presence-chamber, which contains a canopy,
and is hung with tapestry; and which is now used as a passage to the
principal rooms.
</p>
<p>
"There is a suite of five rooms opening into each other successively,
fronting the Park. The Presence-chamber opens into the centre room,
which is denominated the Privy-chamber, in which is a canopy of
flowered-crimson velvet, generally made use of for the King to receive
the Quakers.
</p>
<p>
"On the right are two drawing-rooms, one within the other. At the upper
end of the further one, is a throne with a splendid canopy, on which the
Kings have been accustomed to receive certain addresses. This is called
the Grand Drawing-room, and is used by the King and Queen on certain
state occasions, the nearer room being appropriated as a kind of
ante-chamber, in which the nobility, &amp;c. are permitted to remain while
their Majesties are present in the further room, and is furnished with
stools, sofas, &amp;c. for the purpose. There are two levee-rooms on the
left of the privy-chamber, on entering from the King's guard-room and
presence-chamber, the nearer one serving as an ante-chamber to the
other. They were all of them, formerly, meanly furnished, but at the
time of the marriage of our present King, they were elegantly fitted
up. The walls are now covered with tapestry, very beautiful, and of rich
colours&mdash;tapestry which, although it <span class="pagenum">[73]</span>was made for Charles II. had
never been used, having by some accident lain unnoticed in a chest, till
it was discovered a short time before the marriage of the Prince.
</p>
<p>
"The canopy of the throne was made for the late-Queen's birth-day, the
first which happened after the union of Great Britain and Ireland. It
is made of crimson velvet, with very broad gold lace, embroidered with
crowns set with fine and rich pearls. The shamrock, emblematical of the
Irish nation, forms a part of the decorations of the British crown, and
is executed with great taste and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
"The grand drawing-room contains a large, magnificent chandelier of
silver, gilt, but I believe it has not been lighted for some years; and
in the grand levee-room is a very noble bed, the furniture of which is
of Spitalfields manufacture, in crimson velvet. It was first put up with
the tapestry, on the marriage of the present King, then Prince of Wales.
</p>
<p>
"It is upon the whole an irregular building, chiefly consisting of
several courts and alleys, which lead into the Park. This, however, is
the age of improvement, and it is said that the Palace will shortly
be pulled down, and in the front of St. James's Street a magnificent
triumphal arch is to be erected, to commemorate the glorious victories
of the late war, and to form a grand entrance to the Park.
</p>
<p>
"The Duke of York, the Duke of Clarence, the King's servants, and many
other dignified persons, live in the Stable-yard."
</p>
<p>
"In the Stable-yard!" said Bob, "dignified persons reside in a
Stable-yard, you astonish me!"
</p>
<p>
"It is quite true," said Tom, "and remember it is the Stable-yard of a
King."
</p>
<p>
"I forgot that circumstance," said Bob, "and that circumstances alter
cases. But whose carriage is this driving with so much rapidity?"
</p>
<p>
"That is His Highness the Duke of York, most likely going to pay a visit
to his royal brother, the King, who resides in a Palace a little further
on: which will be in our way, for it is yet too early to see much in
the Park: so let us proceed, I am anxious to make some inquiry about
my antagonist, and therefore mean to take St. Martin's Lane as we go
along."
</p>
<p>
With this they pursued their way along Pall Mall. The rapidity of Tom's
movements however afforded little opportunity for observation or remark,
till they <span class="pagenum">[79]</span>arrived opposite Carlton House, when he called his
Cousin's attention to the elegance of the new streets opposite to it.
</p>
<p>
"That," said he, "is Waterloo Place, which, as well as the memorable
battle after which it is named, has already cost the nation an immense
sum of money, and must cost much more before the proposed improvements
are completed: it is however, the most elegant street in London. The
want of uniformity of the buildings has a striking effect, and gives it
the appearance of a number of palaces. In the time of Queen Elizabeth
there were no such places as Pall Mall, St. James's-street, Piccadilly,
nor any of the streets or fine squares in this part of the town. That
building at the farther end is now the British Fire-office, and has a
pleasing effect at this distance. The cupola on the left belongs to a
chapel, the interior of which for elegant simplicity is unrivalled. To
the left of the centre building is a Circus, and a serpentine street,
not yet finished, which runs to Swallow Street, and thence directly
to Oxford Road, where another circus is forming, and is intended to
communicate with Portland Place; by which means a line of street,
composed of all new buildings, will be completed. Of this dull looking
place (turning to Carlton House) although it is the town-residence
of our King, I shall say nothing at present, as I intend devoting a
morning, along with you, to its inspection. The exterior has not the
most lively appearance, but the interior is magnificent."&mdash;During this
conversation they had kept moving gently on.

<p>
Bob was charmed with the view down Waterloo Place.
</p>
<p>
"That," said his Cousin, pointing to the Arcade at the opposite corner
of Pall Mall, "is the Italian Opera-house, which has recently assumed
its present superb appearance, and may be ranked among the finest
buildings in London. It is devoted to the performance of Italian operas
and French ballets, is generally open from December to July, and
is attended by the most distinguished and fashionable persons. The
improvements in this part are great. That church, which you see in the
distance over the tops of the houses, is St. Martin's in the fields."
</p>
<p>
"In the fields," inquired Bob; "what then, are we come to the end of the
town?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>"Ha! ha! ha!" cried Tom&mdash;"the end&mdash;no, no,&mdash;I was going to say
there is no end to it&mdash;no, we have not reached any thing like the
centre."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Blood an owns, boderation and blarney</i>," (said an Irishman, at that
moment passing them with a hod of mortar on his shoulder, towards the
new buildings, and leaving an ornamental patch as he went along on Bob's
shoulder) "but I'll be a'ter <i>tipping turnups</i>{l} to any b&mdash;&mdash;dy
rogue that's tip to saying&mdash;<i>Black's the white of the blue part of Pat
Murphy's eye</i>; and for that there matter," dropping the hod of mortar
almost on their toes at the same time, and turning round to Bob&mdash;"By the
powers! I ax the Jontleman's pardon&mdash;tho' he's not the first Jontleman
that has carried mortar&mdash;where is that <i>big, bully-faced blackguard</i>
that I'm looking after?" During this he brushed the mortar off Tallyho's
coat with a snap of his fingers, regardless of where or on whom he
distributed it.
</p>
<p>
The offender, it seemed, had taken flight while Pat was apologizing, and
was no where to be found.
</p>
<p>
"Why what's the matter?" inquired Tom; "you seem in a passion."
</p>
<p>
"Och! not in the least bit, your honour! I'm only in a d&mdash;&mdash;d rage. By
the mug of my mother&mdash;arn't it a great shame that a Jontleman of
Ireland can't walk the streets of London without having <i>poratees and
butter-milk</i> throw'd in his gums?"&mdash;Hitching up the waistband of his
breeches&mdash;"It won't do at all at all for Pat: its a reflection on my own
native land, where&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Is hospitality,
          All reality,
          No formality
          There you ever see;
          The free and easy
          Would so amaze ye,
          You'd think us all crazy,
          For dull we never be."
</pre>
<p>
These lines sung with an Irish accent, to the tune of "Morgan Rattler,"
accompanied with a snapping of his fingers, and concluded with a
something in imitation of
</p>
<pre>
     1 <i>Tipping Turnups</i>&mdash;This is a phrase made use of among the
     <i>prigging</i> fraternity, to signify a turn-up&mdash;which is to
     knock down.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>an Irish jilt, were altogether so truly characteristic of the
nation to which he belonged, as to afford our Heroes considerable
amusement. Tom threw him a half-crown, which he picked up with more
haste than he had thrown down the mortar in his rage.
</p>
<p>
"Long life and good luck to the Jontleman!" said Pat. "Sure enough,
I won't be after drinking health and success to your Honour's pretty
picture, and the devil pitch into his own cabin the fellow that would
be after picking a hole or clapping a dirty patch on the coat of St.
Patrick&mdash;whiskey for ever, your Honour, huzza&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "A drop of good whiskey
          Would make a man frisky."
</pre>
<p>
By this time a crowd was gathering round them, and Tom cautioned Bob in
a whisper to beware of his pockets. This piece of advice however came
too late, for his <i>blue bird's eye wipe</i>{l} had taken flight.
</p>
<p>
"What," said Bob, "is this done in open day?" "Are you all right and
tight elsewhere?" said Tom&mdash;"if you are, toddle on and say nothing about
it.&mdash;Open day!" continued he, "aye, the system of <i>frigging</i>{2}
</p>
<pre>
     1  <i>Blue bird's eye wipe</i>&mdash;A blue pocket handkerchief with
     white spots.

     2 A cant term for all sorts of thieving. The Life of the
     celebrated George Barrington, of Old Bailey notoriety, is
     admirably illustrative of this art; which by a more recent
     development of Hardy Vaux, appears to be almost reduced to
     a system, notwithstanding the wholesomeness of our laws and
     the vigilance of our police in their administration. However
     incredible it may appear, such is the force of habit and
     association, the latter, notwithstanding he was detected and
     transported, contrived to continue his depredations during
     his captivity, returned, at the expiration of his term, to
     his native land and his old pursuits, was transported a
     second time, suffered floggings and imprison-ments, without
     correcting what cannot but be termed the vicious
     propensities of his nature. He generally spent his mornings
     in visiting the shops of jewellers, watch-makers,
     pawnbrokers, &amp;c. depending upon his address and appearance,
     and determining to make the whole circuit of the metropolis
     and not to omit a single shop in either of those branches.
     This scheme he actually executed so fully, that he believes
     he did not leave ten untried in London; for he made a point
     of commencing early every day, and went regularly through
     it, taking both sides of the way. His practice on entering a
     shop was to request to look at gold seals,   chains,
     brooches,  rings,  or   any other   small articles of value,
     and while examining them, and looking the shopkeeper in the
     face, he contrived by sleight of hand to conceal two or
     three, sometimes more, as opportunities offered, in the
     sleeve of his coat, which was purposely made wide. In this
     practice he succeeded to a very great extent, and in the
     course of his career was never once detected in the fact,
     though on two or three occa-sions so much suspicion arose
     that he was obliged to exert all his effrontery, and to use
     very high language, in order, as the cant phrase is, to
     bounce the tradesman out of it; his fashionable appearance,
     and affected anger at his insinuations, always had the
     effect of inducing an apology; and in many such cases he has
     actually carried away the spoil, notwithstanding what passed
     between them, and even gone so far as to visit the same shop
     again a second and a third time with as good success as at
     first. This, with his nightly attendance at the Theatres and
     places of public resort, where he picked pockets of watches,
     snuff-boxes, &amp;c. was for a length of time the sole business
     of his life. He was however secured, after secreting himself
     for a time, convicted, and is now transported for life&mdash;as
     he conceives, sold by another cele-brated Prig, whose real
     name was Bill White, but better known by the title of Conky
     Beau.

to&mdash;the expertness with which it is done is almost beyond belief."
</p>
<p>
Bob having ascertained that his handkerchief was the extent of his loss,
they pursued their way towards Charing Cross.
</p>
<p>
"A line of street is intended," continued Tom, "to be made from the
Opera House to terminate with that church; and here is the King's Mews,
which is now turned into barracks."
</p>
<p>
"Stop thief! Stop thief!" was at this moment vociferated in their ears
by a variety of voices, and turning round, they perceived a well-dressed
man at full speed, followed pretty closely by a concourse of people. In
a moment the whole neighbourhood appeared to be in alarm. The up-stairs
windows were crowded with females&mdash;the tradesmen were at their
shop-doors&mdash;the passengers were huddled together in groups, inquiring of
each other&mdash;"What is the matter?&mdash;who is it?&mdash;which is him?&mdash;what has he
done?" while the pursuers were increasing in numbers as they went. The
bustle of the scene was new to Bob&mdash;Charing Cross and its vicinity was
all in motion.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said Tom, "let us see the end of this&mdash;they are sure to <i>nab</i>{l}
my gentleman before he gets much
</p>
<pre>
     1 <i>Nabbed or nibbled</i>&mdash;Secured or taken.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>farther, so let us <i>brush</i>{1} on." Then pulling his Cousin by the
arm, they moved forward to the scene of action.
</p>
<p>
As they approached St. Martin's Lane, the gathering of the crowd, which
was now immense, indicated to Tom a capture.
</p>
<p>
"Button up," said he, "and let us see what's the matter."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Arrah be easy</i>" cried a voice which they instantly recognized to be no
other than Pat Murphy's. "I'll hold you, my dear, till the night after
Doomsday, though I can't tell what day of the year that is. Where's the
man wid the <i>gould-laced skull-cap</i>? Sure enough I tought I'd be up wi'
you, and so now you see I'm down upon you."
</p>
<p>
At this moment a Street-keeper made way through the crowd, and Tom
and Bob keeping close in his rear, came directly up to the principal
performers in this interesting scene, and found honest Pat Murphy
holding the man by his collar, while he was twisting and writhing to get
released from the strong and determined grasp of the athletic Hibernian.
</p>
<p>
Pat no sooner saw our Heroes, than he burst out with a lusty "Arroo!
arroo! there's the sweet-looking jontleman that's been robbed by a dirty
<i>spalpeen</i> that's not worth the tail of a rotten red-herring. I'll give
charge of dis here pick'd bladebone of a dead donkey that walks about in
God's own daylight, dirting his fingers wid what don't belong to him at
all at all. So sure as the devil's in his own house, and that's London,
you've had your pocket pick'd, my darling, and that's news well worth
hearing"&mdash;addressing himself to Dashall.
</p>
<p>
By this harangue it was pretty clearly understood that Murphy had been
in pursuit of the pickpocket, and Tom immediately gave charge.
</p>
<p>
The man, however, continued to declare he was not the right
person&mdash;"That, so help him G&mdash;&mdash;d, the Irishman had got the wrong
bull by the tail&mdash;that he was a b&mdash;&mdash;dy <i>snitch</i>{2} and that he would
<i>sarve him out</i>{3}&mdash;that he wished

<pre>

     2 <i>Snitch</i>&mdash;A term made use of by the light-fingered tribe,
     to signify an informer, by whom they have been impeached or
     betrayed&mdash;So a person who turns king's evidence against his
     accomplices is called a Snitch.

     3 <i>Serve him out</i>&mdash;To punish, or be revenged upon any person
     for any real or supposed injury.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>he might meet him out of St. Giles's, and he would <i>wake</i>{ 1} him
with an <i>Irish howl</i>."
</p>
<pre>
     1 Wake with an Irish howl&mdash;An Irish Wake, which is no
     unfrequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's
     and Saffron Hill, is one of the most comically serious
     ceremonies which can well be conceived, and certainly
     baffles all powers of description. It is, however,
     considered indispensable to wake the body of a de-ceased
     native of the sister kingdom, which is, by a sort of mock
     lying in state, to which all the friends, relatives, and
     fellow countrymen and women, of the dead person, are
     indiscriminately admitted; and among the low Irish this duty
     is frequently performed in a cellar, upon which occasions
     the motley group of assembled Hibernians would form a
     subject for the pencil of the most able satirist.

     Upon one of these occasions, when Murtoch Mulrooney, who had
     suffered the sentence of the law by the common hangman, for
     a footpad robbery, an Englishman was induced by a friend of
     the deceased to accompany him, and has left on record the
     following account of his entertainment:&mdash;

     "When we had descended (says he) about a dozen steps, we
     found ourselves in a subterraneous region, but fortunately
     not uninhabited. On the right sat three old bawds, drinking
     whiskey and smoking tobacco out of pipes about two inches
     long, (by which means, I conceive, their noses had become
     red,) and swearing and blasting between each puff. I was
     immediately saluted by one of the most sober of the ladies,
     and invited to take a glass of the enlivening nectar, and
     led to the bed exactly opposite the door, where Murtoch was
     laid out, and begged to pray for the repose of his precious
     shoul. This, however, I declined, alleging that as the
     parsons were paid for praying, it was their proper business.
     At this moment a coarse female voice exclaimed, in a sort of
     yell or Irish howl, 'Arrah! by Jasus, and why did you die,
     honey?&mdash;Sure enough it was not for the want of milk, meal,
     or tatoes.'

     "In a remote corner of the room, or rather cellar, sat three
     draymen, five of his majesty's body guards, four sailors,
     six haymakers, eight chairmen, and six evidence makers,
     together with three bailiffs' followers, who came by turns
     to view the body, and take a drop of the <i>cratur</i> to drink
     repose to the shoul of their countryman; and to complete the
     group, they were at-tended by the journeyman Jack Ketch. The
     noise and confusion were almost stupefying&mdash;there were
     praying&mdash;swearing&mdash;crying-howling&mdash;smoking&mdash;and drinking.

     "At the head of the bed where the remains of Murtoch were
     laid, was the picture of the Virgin Mary on one side, and
     that of St. Patrick on the other; and at the feet was
     depicted the devil and some of his angels, with the blood
     running down their backs, from the flagellations which they
     had received from the disciples of Ketigern. Whether the
     blue devils were flying around or not, I could not exactly
     discover, but the whiskey and <i>blue ruin</i> were evidently
     powerful in their effects.

     "One was swearing&mdash;a second   counting  his   beads&mdash;a
     third descanting on the good qualities of his departed
     friend, and about to try those of the whiskey&mdash;a fourth
     evacuating that load with which he had already overloaded
     himself&mdash;a fifth, declaring he could carry a fare, hear
     mass, knock down a member of parliament, murder a peace
     officer, and after all receive a pension: and while the
     priest was making an assignation with a sprightly female
     sprig of Shelalah, another was jonteelly picking his pocket.
     I had seen enough, and having no desire to continue in such
     company, made my escape with as much speed as I could from
     this animated group of persons, assembled as they were upon
     so solemn an occasion."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>With conversation of this kind, the party were amused up St.
Martin's lane, and on the remainder of the road to Bow-street, followed
by many persons, some of whom pretended to have seen a part of the
proceedings, and promised to give their evidence before the magistrate,
who was then sitting.
</p>
<p>
On arriving in Bow Street, they entered the Brown Bear,{1} a
public-house, much frequented by the officers, and in which is a
strong-room for the safe custody of prisoners, where they were shewn
into a dark back-parlour, as they termed it, and the officer proceeded
to search the man in custody, when lo and behold! the handkerchief was
not to be found about him.
</p>
<p>
Pat d&mdash;&mdash;d the devil and all his works&mdash;swore "by the fiery furnace of
Beelzebub, and that's the devil's own bed-chamber, that was the man
that nibbled the Jontleman's <i>dive</i>,{2} and must have <i>ding'd away the
wipe</i>,{3} or else what should he <i>bolt</i>{4} for?&mdash;that he was up to the
<i>rum slum</i>,{5}
</p>
<pre>
     1 A former landlord of the house facetiously christened it
     the Russian Hotel, and had the words painted under the sign
     of Bruin.

     2 <i>Nibbled the Jontleman's dive</i>&mdash;Picked the gentleman's
     pocket.

     3 <i>Ding'd away the wipe</i>&mdash;Passed away the handkerchief to
     another, to escape detection. This is a very common practice
     in London: two or three in a party will be near, without
     appearing to have the least knowledge of, or connexion with
     each other, and the moment a depredation is committed by
     one, he transfers the property to one of his pals, by whom
     it is conveyed perhaps to the third, who decamps with it to
     some receiver, who will immediately advance money upon it;
     while, if any suspicion should fall upon the first, the
     second will perhaps busy himself in his endeavours to secure
     the offender, well knowing no proof of possession can be
     brought against him.

     4 <i>Bolt</i>&mdash;Run away; try to make an escape.

     5 <i>Rum slum</i>&mdash;Gammon&mdash;queer talk or action, in which some
     fraudulent intentions are discoverable or suspected.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>and down upon the <i>kiddies</i>{1}&mdash;and sure enough you're <i>boned,</i>{2}
my dear boy."
</p>
<p>
Some of the officers came in, and appeared to know the prisoner well,
as if they had been acquainted with each other upon former official
business; but as the lost property was not found upon him, it was the
general opinion that nothing could be done, and the accused began to
exercise his wit upon Murphy, which roused Pat's blood:
</p>
<p>
"For the least thing, you know, makes an Irishman roar."
</p>
<p>
At length, upon charging him with having been caught <i>blue-pigeon
flying,</i>{3} Pat gave him the lie in his teeth&mdash;swore he'd fight him for
all the <i>blunt</i>{4} he had about him, "which to be sure," said he, "is
but a sweet pretty half-a-crown, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to you&mdash;good luck
to it! Here goes," throwing the half-crown upon the floor, which the
prisoner attempted to pick up, but was prevented by Pat's stamping his
foot upon it, while he was <i>doffing his jacket</i>,{5} exclaiming&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Arrah, be after putting your dirty fingers in your pocket, and don't
spoil the King's picture by touching it&mdash;devil burn me, but I'll <i>mill
your mug to muffin dust</i>{6} before I'll give up that beautiful looking
bit; so tip us your mauley,{7} and no more blarney."

     2 Boned&mdash;Taken or secured.

     s Blue pigeon flying&mdash;The practice of stealing lead from
     houses, churches, or other buildings. A species of
     depredation very prevalent in London and its vicinity, and
     which is but too much encouraged by the readiness with which
     it can be disposed of to the plumbers in general.

     4 Blunt&mdash;A flash term for money.

     5 Doffing his Jacket&mdash;Taking off his jacket.

     6 Mill your mug to muffin dust&mdash;The peculiarity of the Irish
     character for overstrained metaphor, may perhaps, in some
     degree, account for the Hibernian's idea of beating his head
     to flour, though he was afterwards inclined to commence his
     operations in the true style and character of the prize
     ring, where

     "Men shake hands before they box, Then give each other
     plaguy knocks, With all the love and kindness of a brother."

     7 Tip us your mauley&mdash;Give me your hand. Honour is so sacred
     a thing with the Irish, that the rapid transition from a
     violent expression to the point of honour, is no uncommon
     thing amongst them; and in this instance it is quite clear
     that although he meant to mill the mug of his opponent to
     muffin dust, he had a notion of the thing, and intended to
     do it in an honourable way.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>During this conversation, the spectators, who were numerous, were
employed in endeavouring to pacify the indignant Hibernian, who by this
time had buffid it, or, in other words, <i>peeled in prime twig</i>,{1} for
a regular <i>turn to.</i>{2} All was noise and confusion, when a new group
of persons entered the room&mdash;another capture had been made, and another
charge given. It was however with some difficulty that honest Pat Murphy
was prevailed upon to remain a little quiet, while one of the officers
beckoned Dashall out of the room, and gave him to understand that the
man in custody, just brought in, was a well-known <i>pal</i>{3} of the one
first suspected, though they took not the least notice of each other
upon meeting. In the mean time, another officer in the room had been
searching the person of the last captured, from whose bosom he drew the
identical handkerchief of Bob; and the Irishman recollected seeing him
in the crowd opposite the Opera House.
</p>
<p>
This cleared up the mystery in some degree, though the two culprits
affected a total ignorance of each other. The property of the person
who had given the last charge was also discovered, and it was deemed
absolutely necessary to take them before the Magistrate. But as some
new incidents will arise on their introduction to the office, we shall
reserve them for the next Chapter.

</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>ON entering the Public Office, Bow-street, we must leave our
readers to guess at the surprise and astonishment with which the Hon.
Tom Dashall and his Cousin beheld their lost friend, Charles Sparkle,
who it appeared had been kindly accommodated with a lodging gratis in
a neighbouring watch-house, not, as it may readily be supposed, exactly
suitable to his taste or inclination. Nor was wonder less excited in the
mind of Sparkle at this unexpected meeting, as unlooked for as it
was fortunate to all parties. There was however no opportunity at the
present moment for an explanation, as the worthy Magistrate immediately
proceeded to an investigation of the case just brought before him, upon
which there was no difficulty in deciding. The charge was made, the
handkerchief sworn to, and the men, who <span class="pagenum">[89]</span>were well known as old
hands upon the town, committed for trial. The most remarkable feature in
the examination being the evidence of Pat Murphy, who by this time
had recollected that the man who was taken with the property about his
person, was the very identical aggressor who had offended him while the
hod of mortar was on his shoulder, before the conversation commenced
between himself and Tom opposite the Opera-house.
</p>
<p>
"Sure enough, your Honour," said he, "its a true bill. I'm an Irishman,
and I don't care who knows it&mdash;I don't fight under false colours, but
love the land of potatoes, and honour St. Patrick. That there man with
the <i>blue toggery</i>{1} tipp'd me a bit of blarney, what did not suit my
stomach. I dropp'd my load, which he took for an order to quit, and so
<i>mizzled</i>{2} out of my way, or by the big bull of Ballynafad, I'd have
powdered his wig with brick-dust, and bothered his bread-basket with a
little human kindness in the shape of an Irishman's fist; and then that
there other dirty end of a shelalah, while the Jontleman&mdash;long life to
your Honour, (bowing to Tom Dashall)&mdash;was houlding a bit of conversation
with Pat Murphy, <i>grabb'd</i>{3} his pocket-handkerchief, and was after
shewing a leg,{4} when a little boy that kept his oglers upon 'em, let
me into the secret, and let the cat out of the bag by bawling&mdash;Stop
thief! He darted off like a cow at the sound of the bagpipes, and I
boulted a'ter him like a good'un; so when I came up to him, Down you go,
says I, and down he was; and that's all I know about the matter."
</p>
<p>
As the prisoners were being taken out of court, the Hibernian followed
them. "Arrah," said he, "my lads, as I have procured you a lodging for
nothing, here's the half-a-crown, what the good-looking Jontleman gave
me; it may sarve you in time of need, so take it along with you, perhaps
you may want it more than I do; and if you know the pleasure of spending
money that is honestly come by, it may teach you a lesson that may keep
you out of the clutches of Jock Ketch, and save

     general, but is made use of to describe a blue coat.

     3 Grabb'd&mdash;Took, or stole.

<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>you from dying in a horse's night-cap{1}&mdash;there, be off wid you."
</p>
<p>
The Hon. Tom Dashall, who had carefully watched the proceedings of Pat,
could not help moralizing upon this last act of the Irishman, and the
advice which accompanied it. "Here," said he to himself, "is a
genuine display of national character. Here is the heat, the fire, the
effervescence, blended with the generosity and open-heartedness, so much
boasted of by the sons of Erin, and so much eulogized by travellers who
have visited the Emerald Isle." And slipping a sovereign into his hand,
after the execution of a bond to prosecute the offenders, each of them
taking an arm of Sparkle, they passed down Bow-street, conversing on the
occurrences in which they had been engaged, of which the extraordinary
appearance of Sparkle was the most prominent and interesting.
</p>
<p>
"How in the name of wonder came you in such a scrape?" said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Innocently enough, I can assure you," replied Sparkle&mdash;"with my usual
luck&mdash;a bit of gig, a lark, and a turn up.{2}
</p>
<pre>
          "... 'Twas waxing rather late,
          And reeling bucks the street began to scour,
          While guardian watchmen, with a tottering gait,
          Cried every thing quite clear, except the hour."

     1  Horse's night-cap&mdash;A halter.

     2 A bit of gig&mdash;a lark&mdash;a turn up&mdash;are terms made use of to
     signify a bit of fun of any kind, though the latter more
     generally means a fight. Among the bucks and bloods of the
     Metropolis, a bit of fun or a lark, as they term it, ending
     in a milling match, a night's lodging in the watch-house,
     and a composition with the Charleys in the morning, to avoid
     exposure before the Magistrate, is a proof of high spirit&mdash;a
     prime delight, and serves in many cases to stamp a man's
     character. Some, however, who have not courage enough to
     brave a street-row and its consequences, are fond of fun of
     other kinds, heedless of the consequences to others. "Go it,
     my boys," says one of the latter description, "keep it up,
     huzza! I loves fun&mdash;for I made such a fool of my father last
     April day:&mdash;but what do you think I did now, eh?&mdash;Ha! ha!
     ha!&mdash;I will tell you what makes me laugh so: we were
     keeping it up in prime twig, faith, so about four o'clock in
     the morning 1 went down into the kitchen, and there was Dick
     the waiter snoring like a pig before a blazing fire&mdash;done
     up, for the fellow can't keep it up as we jolly boys do: So
     thinks 1, I'll have you, my boy&mdash;and what does I do, but I
     goes softly and takes the tongs, and gets a red hot coal as
     big as my head, and plumpt it upon the fellow's foot and run
     away, because I loves fun, you know: So it has lamed him,
     and that makes me laugh so&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;it was what I call
     better than your <i>rappartees</i> and your <i>bobinâtes</i>. I'll
     tell you more too: you must know I was in high tip-top
     spirits, faith, so I stole a dog from a blind man&mdash;for I do
     loves fun: so then the blind man cried for his dog, and that
     made me laugh heartily: So says I to the blind man&mdash;Hallo,
     Master, what a you a'ter, what is you up to? does you want
     your dog?&mdash;Yes, Sir, says he. Now only you mark what I said
     to the blind man&mdash;Then go and look for him, old chap, says
     I&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;that's your sort, my boy, keep it up, keep
     it up, d&mdash;&mdash; me.    That's the worst of it, I always turn
     sick when I think of a Parson&mdash;I always do; and my brother
     he is a parson too, and he hates to hear any body swear: so
     you know I always swear like a trooper when I am near him,
     on purpose to roast him. I went to dine with him one day
     last week, and there was my sisters, and two or three more
     of what you call your modest women; but I sent 'em all from
     the table, and then laugh'd at 'em, for I loves fun, and
     that was fun alive 0. And so there was nobody in the room
     but my brother and me, and I begun to swear most sweetly: I
     never swore so well in all my life&mdash;I swore all my new
     oaths; it would have done you good to have heard me swear;
     till at last my brother looked frightened, and d&mdash;&mdash; me that
     was good fun.    At last, he lifted up his hands and eyes to
     Heaven, and calls out <i>O tempora, O mores!</i> But I was not to
     be done so. Oh! oh! Brother, says I, what you think to
     frighten me by calling all your family about you; but I
     don't care for you, nor your family neither&mdash;so stow it&mdash;
     I'll mill the whole troop&mdash;Only bring your Tempora and Mores
     here, that's all&mdash;let us have fair play, I'll tip 'em the
     Gas in a flash of lightning&mdash;I'll box 'em for five pounds,
     d&mdash;&mdash; me:  here, where's Tempora and Mores, where are they?
     My eyes, how he did stare when he see me ready for a set to&mdash;
     I never laugh'd so in my life&mdash;he made but two steps out of
     the room, and left me master of the field.    What d'ye
     think of that for a lark, eh?&mdash;Keep it up&mdash;keep it up, d&mdash;&mdash;
     me, says I&mdash;so I sets down to the table, drank as much as I
     could&mdash;then I mix'd the heel-taps all in one bottle, and
     broke all the empty ones&mdash;then bid adieu to Tempora and
     Mores, and rolled home in a hackney-coach in prime and
     plummy order, d&mdash;&mdash; me."

"Coming along Piccadilly last night after leaving you, I was overtaken
at the corner of Rupert-street by our old college-companion Harry
Hartwell, pursuing his way to the Hummums, where it seems he has taken
up his abode. Harry, you remember, never was exactly one of us; he
studies too much, and pores everlastingly over musty old volumes of
Law Cases, Blackstone's Commentaries, and other black books, to qualify
himself for the black art, and as fit and proper person to appear at
the Bar. The length of time that had elapsed since our last meeting was
sufficient inducement for us to crack a bottle together; <span class="pagenum">[92]</span>so taking
his arm, we proceeded to the place of destination, where we sat talking
over past times, and indulging our humour till half-past one o'clock,
when I sallied forth on my return to Long's, having altogether abandoned
my original intention of calling in Golden-square. At the corner of
Leicester-square, my ears were assailed with a little of the night
music&mdash;the rattles were in full chorus, and the Charleys, in prime
twig,{1} were mustering from all quarters.

"The street was all alive, and I made my way through the crowd to the
immediate scene of action, which was rendered peculiarly interesting by
the discovery of a dainty bit of female beauty shewing fight with half
a dozen watchmen, in order to extricate herself from the grasp of these
guardians of our peace. She was evidently under the influence of
the Bacchanalian god, which invigorated her arm, without imparting
discretion to her head, and she laid about her with such dexterity, that
the old files{2} were fearful of losing their prey; but the odds were
fearfully against her, and never did I feel my indignation more aroused,
than when I beheld a sturdy ruffian aim a desperate blow at her head
with his rattle, which in all probability, had it taken the intended
effect, would have sent her in search of that peace in the other world,
of which she was experiencing so little in this. It was not possible
for me to stand by, an idle spectator of the destruction of a female
who appeared to have no defender, whatever might be the nature of the
offence alleged or committed. I therefore warded off the blow with my
left arm, and with my right gave him a well-planted blow on the conk,{3}
which sent him piping into the kennel. In a moment I was surrounded and
charged with a violent assault upon the charley,{4} and interfering with
the guardians of the night in the execution of their duty. A complete
diversion took place from the original object of their fury, and in the
bustle to secure me, the unfortunate girl made her escape, where to, or
how, heaven

boldly along with the scouts{1} to St. Martin's watch-house, where we
arrived just as a hackney coach drew up to the door.
</p>
<p>
"Take her in, d&mdash;&mdash;n her eyes, she shall <i>stump up the rubbish</i>{2}
before I leave her, or give me the address of her <i>flash covey</i>,{3}
and so here goes." By this time we had entered the watch-house, where
I perceived the awful representative of justice seated in an arm chair,
with a good blazing fire, smoking his pipe in consequential ease.
A crowd of Charleys, with broken lanterns, broken heads, and other
symptoms of a row, together with several casual spectators, had gained
admittance, when Jarvis entered, declaring&mdash;By G&mdash;&mdash;he wouldn't be
choused by any wh&mdash;&mdash;re or cull in Christendom, and he would make 'em
come down pretty handsomely, or he'd know the reason why: "And so please
your Worship, Sir"&mdash;then turning round, "hallo," said he, "Sam, what's
becom'd of that there voman&mdash;eh&mdash;vhat, you've been playing booty eh, and
let her escape." The man to whom this was intended to be addressed did
not appear to be present, as no reply was made. However, the case was
briefly explained.
</p>
<p>
"But, by G&mdash;&mdash;, I von't put any thing in Sam's vay again," cried
Jarvey.{4} For my own part, as I knew nothing of the occurrences
adverted to, I was as much in the dark as if I had gone home without
interruption. The representations of the Charleys proved decisive
against me&mdash;in vain I urged the cause of humanity, and the necessity
I felt of protecting a defenceless female from the violence of
accumulating numbers, and that I had done no more than every man ought
to have done upon such an occasion. <i>Old puff and swill</i>, the lord
of the night, declared that I must have acted with malice
afore-thought&mdash;that I was a pal in the concern, and that I had been
instrumental in the design of effecting a rescue; and, after a very
short deliberation, he concluded that I must be a notorious rascal, and
desired me to make up my mind to remain with him for the remainder of
the night. Not relishing this, I proposed to send for bail, assuring him
of my

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>attendance in the morning; but was informed it could not be
accepted of, as it was clearly made out against me that I had committed
a violent breach of the peace, and nothing at that time could be
produced that would prove satisfactory. Under these circumstances, and
partly induced by a desire to avoid being troublesome in other quarters,
I submitted to a restraint which it appeared I could not very well
avoid, and, taking my seat in an arm-chair by the fire-side, I soon fell
fast asleep, from which I was only aroused by the occasional entrances
and exits of the guardians, until between four and five o'clock, when
a sort of general muster of the Charleys took place, and each one
depositing his nightly paraphernalia, proceeded to his own habitation.
Finding the liberation of others from their duties would not have the
effect of emancipating me from my confinement, which was likely to
be prolonged to eleven, or perhaps twelve o'clock, I began to feel
my situation as a truly uncomfortable one, when I was informed by the
watch-house keeper, who resides upon the spot, that he was going to
<i>turn in</i>,{1} that there was fire enough to last till his wife turn'd
out, which would be about six o'clock, and, as I had the appearance of a
gentleman, if there was any thing I wanted, she would endeavour to make
herself useful in obtaining it. "But Lord," said he, "there is no such
thing as believing any body now-a-days&mdash;there was such sets out, and
such manouvering, that nobody knew nothing of nobody."
</p>
<p>
"I am obliged to you, my friend," said I, "for this piece of
information, and in order that you may understand something of the
person you are speaking to beyond the mere exterior view, here is
half-a-crown for your communication."
</p>
<p>
"Why, Sir," said he, laying on at the same moment a shovel of coals,
"this here makes out what I said&mdash;Don't you see, said I, that 'are
Gentleman is a gentleman every inch of him, says I&mdash;as don't want
nothing at all no more nor what is right, and if so be as how he's got
himself in a bit of a hobble, I knows very well as how he's got
the tip{2} in his pocket, and does'nt want for spirit to pull it
out&mdash;Perhaps you might like some breakfast, sir?"
</p>
<pre>
     1  Turn in&mdash;Going to bed. This is a term most in use among
     seafaring men.

     2 Tip is synonymous with blunt, and means money.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>"Why yes," said I&mdash;for I began to feel a little inclined that way.
</p>
<p>
"O my wife, Sir," said he, "will do all you want, when she rouses
herself."
</p>
<p>
"I suppose," continued I, "you frequently have occasion to accommodate
persons in similar situations?"
</p>
<p>
"Lord bless you! yes, sir, and a strange set of rum customers we have
too sometimes&mdash;why it was but a few nights ago we had 'em stowed here
as thick as three in a bed. We had 'em all upon the <i>hop</i>{1}&mdash;you never
see'd such fun in all your life, and this here place was as full of
curiosities as Pidcock's at Exeter Change, or Bartlemy-fair&mdash;Show 'em up
here, all alive alive O!"
</p>
<p>
"Indeed!" said I, feeling a little inquisitive on the subject; "and how
did this happen?"
</p>
<p>
"Why it was a <i>rummish</i> piece of business altogether. There was a large
party of dancing fashionables all met together for a little jig in St.
Martin's lane, and a very pretty medley there was of them. The fiddlers
wagg'd their elbows, and the lads and lasses their trotters, till about
one o'clock, when, just as they were in the midst of a quadrille, in
burst the officers, and quickly changed the tune. The appearance of
these gentlemen had an instantaneous effect upon all parties present:
the cause of their visit was explained, and the whole squad taken into
custody, to give an account of themselves, and was brought here in
hackney-coaches. The delicate Miss and her assiduous partner, who, a
short time before had been all spirits and animation, were now sunk in
gloomy reflections upon the awkwardness of their situation; and many of
our inhabitants would have fainted when they were informed they would
have to appear before the Magistrate in the morning, but for the
well-timed introduction of a little drap of the <i>cratur</i>, which an Irish
lady ax'd me to fetch for her. But the best of the fun was, that in the
group we had a Lord and a Parson! For the dignity of the one, and the
honour of the other, they were admitted to bail&mdash;Lord have mercy upon
us! said the Parson&mdash;Amen, said the Lord; and this had the desired
effect upon the Constable of the night, for he let them off on the sly,
you understand: But my eyes what work there was in the morning! sixteen
Jarveys, full of live lumber,
</p>
<pre>
     1 Hop&mdash;A dance.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>were taken to Bow-street, in a nice pickle you may be sure,
dancing-pumps and silk-stockings, after setting in the watch-house all
night, and surrounded by lots of people that hooted and howled, as the
procession passed along, in good style. They were safely landed at the
Brown Bear, from which they were handed over in groups to be examined
by the Magistrate, when the men were discharged upon giving satisfactory
accounts, and the women after some questions being put to them. You see
all this took place because they were dancing in an unlicensed room. It
was altogether a laughable set-out as ever you see'd&mdash;the Dandys and
the Dandyzettes&mdash;the Exquisites&mdash;the Shopmen&mdash;the Ladies' maid and the
Prentice Boys&mdash;my Lord and his Reverence&mdash;mingled up higgledy-piggledy,
pigs in the straw, with Bow-street Officers, Runners and
Watchmen&mdash;Ladies squalling and fainting, Men swearing and almost
fighting. It would have been a pleasure to have kick'd up a row that
night, a purpose to get admission&mdash;you would have been highly amused,
I'll assure you&mdash;good morning, Sir." And thus saying, he turned the lock
upon me, and left me to my meditations. In about a couple of hours
the old woman made her appearance, and prepared me some coffee; and at
eleven o'clock came the Constable of the night, to accompany me before
the Magistrate.
</p>
<p>
"Aware that the circumstances were rather against me, and that I had no
right to interfere in other persons' business or quarrels, I consulted
him upon the best mode of making up the matter; for although I had
really done no more than becomes a man in protecting a female, I had
certainly infringed upon the law, in effecting the escape of a person in
custody, and consequently was liable to the penalty or penalties in such
cases made and provided. On our arrival at the Brown Bear, I was met
by a genteel-looking man, who delivered me a letter, and immediately
disappeared. Upon breaking the seal, I found its contents as follows:
</p>
<p>
Dear Sir, Although unknown to me, I have learned enough of your
character to pronounce you a trump, a prime cock, and nothing but a good
one. I am detained by John Doe and Richard Roe with their d&mdash;&mdash;d <i>fieri
facias</i>, or I should be with you. However, I trust you will excuse the
liberty I take in requesting you will make use of the enclosed for the
purpose of shaking yourself out of the <span class="pagenum">[97]</span>hands of the scouts and
their pals. We shall have some opportunities of meeting, when I will
explain: in the mean time, believe me I am
</p>
<p>
Your's truly,
</p>
<p>
Tom.
</p>
<p>
"With this advice, so consonant with my own opinion, I immediately
complied; and having satisfied the broken-headed Charley, and paid all
expences incurred, I was induced to walk into the office merely to give
a look around me, when by a lucky chance I saw you enter. And thus you
have a full, true, and particular account of the peregrinations of your
humble servant."
</p>
<p>
Listening with close attention to this narrative of Sparkle's, all other
subjects had escaped observation, till they found themselves in the
Strand.
</p>
<p>
"Whither are we bound?" inquired Sparkle.
</p>
<p>
"On a voyage of discoveries," replied Dashall, "and we just wanted you
to act as pilot."
</p>
<p>
"What place is this?" inquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"That," continued Sparkle, "is Somerset-house. It is a fine old
building; it stands on the banks of the Thames, raised on piers and
arches, and is now appropriated to various public offices, and houses
belonging to the various offices of the Government."
</p>
<p>
"The terrace, which lies on the river, is very fine, and may be well
viewed from Waterloo Bridge. The front in the Strand, you perceive,
has a noble aspect, being composed of a rustic basement, supporting a
Corinthian order of columns crowned with an attic in the centre, and at
the extremities with a balustrade. The south front, which looks into the
court, is very elegant in its composition.
</p>
<p>
"The basement consists of nine large arches; and three in the centre
open, forming the principal entrance; and three at each end, filled with
windows of the Doric order, are adorned with pilasters, entablatures,
and pediments. On the key-stones of the nine arches are carved, in alto
relievo, nine colossal masks, representing the Ocean, and the eight main
Rivers of England, viz. <i>Thames, Humber, Mersey, Dee, Medway, Tweed,
Tyne, and Severn</i>, with appropriate emblems to denote their various
characters.
</p>
<p>
"Over the basement the Corinthian order consists of ten columns upon
pedestals, having their regular entablature. It comprehends two
floors, and the attic in the centre of the front extends over three
intercolomniations, and is divided into three parts by four colossal
statues placed on <span class="pagenum">[98]</span>the columns of the order. It terminates with a
group consisting of the arms of the British empire, supported on one
side by the Genius of England, and by Fame, sounding the trumpet, on the
other. These three open arches in the front form the principal entrance
to the whole of the structure, and lead to an elegant vestibule
decorated with Doric columns.
</p>
<p>
"The terrace, which fronts the Thames, is spacious, and commands a
beautiful view of part of the river, including Blackfriars, Waterloo,
and Westminster Bridges. It is reared on a grand rustic basement,
having thirty-two spacious arches. The arcade thus formed is judiciously
relieved by projections ornamented with rusticated columns, and the
effect of the whole of the terrace from the water is truly grand and
noble. There is however, at present, no admission for the public to
it; but, in all probability, it will be open to all when the edifice is
completed, which would form one of the finest promenades in the world,
and prove to be one of the first luxuries of the metropolis.
</p>
<p>
"That statue in the centre is a representation of our late King, George
the Third, with the Thames at his feet, pouring wealth and plenty from
a large Cornucopia. It is executed by Bacon, and has his characteristic
cast of expression. It is in a most ludicrous situation, being placed
behind, and on the brink of a deep area.
</p>
<p>
"In the vestibule are the rooms of the Royal Society, the Society of
Antiquarians, and the Royal Academy of Arts, all in a very grand and
beautiful style. Over the door of the Royal Academy is a bust of Michael
Angelo; and over the door leading to the Royal Society and Society of
Antiquarians, you will find the bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
</p>
<p>
"The Government-offices, to which this building is devoted, are objects
of great astonishment to strangers, being at once commodious and
elegant, and worthy the wealth of the nation to which they belong. The
hall of the Navy office is a fine room with two fronts, one facing the
terrace and river, and the other facing the court. On the right is the
Stamp-office: it consists of a multitude of apartments: the room in
which the stamping is executed is very interesting to the curious. On
the left you see the Pay-office of the Navy.
</p>
<p>
"The principal thing to attract notice in this edifice is <span class="pagenum">[99]</span>the
solidity and completeness of the workmanship in the masonry, and indeed
in every other part."
</p>
<p>
After taking a rather prolonged view of this elegant edifice, they again
sallied forth into the Strand, mingling with all the noise and bustle
of a crowded street, where by turns were to be discovered, justling each
other, parsons, lawyers, apothecaries, projectors, excisemen, organists,
picture-sellers, bear and monkey-leaders, fiddlers and bailiffs. The
barber and the chimney-sweeper were however always observed to be
careful in avoiding the touch of each other, as if contamination must be
the inevitable consequence.
</p>
<p>
"My dear fellow!" exclaimed a tall and well-dressed person, who dragged
the Honourable Tom Dashall on one side&mdash;"you are the very person I
wanted&mdash;I'm very glad to see you in town again&mdash;but I have not a moment
to spare&mdash;the blood-hounds are in pursuit&mdash;this term will be ended
in two days, then comes the long vacation&mdash;liberty without hiring
a horse&mdash;you understand&mdash;was devilishly afraid of being nabb'd just
now&mdash;should have been dished if I had&mdash;lend me five shillings&mdash;come,
make haste."
</p>
<p>
"Five shillings, Diddler, when am I to be paid? you remember&mdash;' When I
grow rich' was the reply."
</p>
<p>
"Know&mdash;yes, I know all about it&mdash;but no matter, I'm not going to settle
accounts just now, so don't detain me, I hate Debtor and Creditor.
Fine sport to-morrow, eh&mdash;shall be at the Ring&mdash;in cog.&mdash;take no
notice&mdash;disguised as a Quaker&mdash;Obadiah Lankloaks&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;d large beaver
hat, and hide my physog.&mdash;Lend me what silver you have, and be quick
about it, for I can't stay&mdash;thank you, you're a d&mdash;&mdash;a good fellow,
Tom, a trump&mdash;shall now pop into a hack, and drive into another
county&mdash;thank ye&mdash;good day&mdash;by by."
</p>
<p>
During this harangue, while Tost was counting his silver, the ingenious
Mr. Diddler seized all he had, and whipping it speedily into his pocket,
in a few minutes was out of his sight.
</p>
<p>
Sparkle observing Dashall looking earnestly after Diddler, approached,
and giving him a lusty slap on the shoulder&mdash;"Ha! ha! ha!" exclaimed he,
"what are you done again?"
</p>
<p>
"I suppose so," said Dashall; "confound the fellow, he is always
borrowing: I never met him in my life but <span class="pagenum">[100]</span>he had some immediate
necessity or other to require a loan of a little temporary supply, as he
calls it."
</p>
<p>
"I wonder," said Sparkle, "that you are so ready to lend, after such
frequent experience&mdash;how much does he owe you?"
</p>
<p>
"Heaven only knows," continued Tom, "for I do not keep account against
him, I must even trust to his honour&mdash;so it is useless to stand here
losing our time&mdash;Come, let us forward."
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart,", said Sparkle, "and with permission I propose a
visit to the Bonassus, a peep at St. Paul's, and a chop at Dolly's."
</p>
<p>
This proposition being highly approved of, they continued their
walk along the Strand, towards Temple Bar, and in a few minutes were
attracted by the appearance of men dressed in the garb of the Yeomen of
the Guards, who appeared active in the distribution of hand-bills, and
surrounded a house on the front of which appeared a long string of high
and distinguished names, as patrons and patronesses of the celebrated
animal called the Bonassus. Crossing the road in their approach to
the door, Tallyho could not help admiring the simple elegance of a
shop-front belonging to a grocer, whose name is Peck.
</p>
<p>
"Very handsome and tasty, indeed," replied Sparkle; "that combination of
marble and brass has a light and elegant effect: it has no appearance of
being laboured at. The inhabitant of the house I believe is a foreigner,
I think an Italian; but London boasts of some of the most elegant shops
in the world." And by this time they entered the opposite house.

    CHAPTER IX
</h2>
<pre>
          "In London my life is a ring of delight,
          In frolics I keep up the day and the night;
          I snooze at the Hummums till twelve, perhaps later,
          I rattle the bell, and I roar up the Waiter;
          'Your Honour,' says he, and he makes me a leg;
          He brings me my tea, but I swallow an egg;
          For tea in a morning's a slop I renounce,
          So I down with a glass of good right cherry-bounce.

          Staggering:
          So thoughtless, so knowing, so green and so mellow,
          This, this is the life of a frolicsome fellow."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>UPON entering the house, and depositing their shilling each to
view this newly discovered animal from the Apalachian mountains of
America, and being supplied with immense long bills descriptive of his
form and powers&mdash;"Come along (said Sparkle,) let us have a look at the
most wonderful production of nature&mdash;only seventeen months old, five
feet ten inches high, and one of the most fashionable fellows in the
metropolis."
</p>
<p>
"It should seem so," said Tallyho, "by the long list of friends and
visitors that are detailed in the commencement of the bill of fare."
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps," said Tom, "there are more Bon asses than one."
</p>
<p>
"Very likely (continued Sparkle;) but let me tell you the allusion in
this case does not apply, for this animal has nothing of the donkey
about him, and makes no noise, as you will infer from the following
lines in the Bill:
</p>
<pre>
          "As the Bonassus does not roar,
          His fame is widely known,
          For no dumb animal before
          Has made such noise in town."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>At this moment the barking of a dog assailed their ears, and
suspended the conversation. Passing onward to the den of the Bonassus,
they found a dark-featured gentleman of middling stature, with his hair,
whiskers, and ears, so bewhitened with powder as to form a complete
contrast with his complexion and a black silk handkerchief which he wore
round his neck, holding a large brown-coloured dog by the collar, in
order to prevent annoyance to the visitors.
</p>
<p>
"D&mdash;&mdash;n the dog, (exclaimed he) although he is the best tempered
creature in the world, he don't seem to like the appearance of the
Bonassus "&mdash;and espying Sparkle, "Ha, my dear fellow! how are you?&mdash;I
have not seen you for a long while."
</p>
<p>
"Why, Sir D&mdash;n&mdash;ll, I am happy to say I never was better in my
life&mdash;allow me to introduce you to my two friends, the Hon. Mr. Dashall,
and Robert Tallyho&mdash;Sir D&mdash;n&mdash;ll Harlequin."
</p>
<p>
The mutual accompaniments of such an introduction having passed among
them, the Knight, who was upon the moment of departure as they entered,
expressed his approbation of the animal he had been viewing, and,
lugging his puppy by one hand, and his cudgel in the other, wished them
a good morning.

"There is an eccentric man of Title," continued Sparkle.
</p>
<p>
"I should judge," said Bob, "there was a considerable portion of
eccentricity about him, by his appearance. Is he a Baronet?"
</p>
<p>
"A Baronet," (replied Sparkle) "no, no, he is no other than a <i>Quack
Doctor</i>."{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 Of all the subjects that afford opportunities for the
     satiric pen in the Metropolis, perhaps there is none more
     abundant or prolific than that of Quackery. Dr. Johnson
     observes, that "<i>cheats can seldom stand long against
     laughter</i>." But if a judgment is really to be formed from
     existing facts, it may be supposed that times are so
     materially changed since the residence of that able writer
     in this sublunary sphere, that the reverse of the position
     may with greater propriety be asserted. For such is the
     prevailing practice of the present day, that, according to
     the opinion of thousands, there is nothing to be done
     without a vast deal more of profession and pretence than
     actual power, and he who is the best able to bear laughing
     at, is the most likely to realize the hopes he entertains of
     obtaining celebrity, and of having his labours crowned with
     success. Nothing can be more evident than this in the
     Medical profession, though there are successful Quacks of
     all kinds, and in all situations, to be found in London.
     This may truly be called the age of Quackery, from the
     abundance of impostors of every kind that prey upon society;
     and such as cannot or will not think for themselves, ought
     to be guarded in a publication of this nature, against the
     fraudulent acts of those persons who make it their business
     and profit to deteriorate the health, morals, and amusements
     of the public. But, in the present instance, we are speaking
     of the Medical Quack only, than which perhaps there is none
     more remarkable.

     The race of Bossys, Brodrums, Solomons, Perkins, Chamants,
     &amp;c. is filled by others of equal notoriety, and no doubt of
     equal utility. The Cerfs, the Curries, the Lamerts, the
     Ruspinis, the Coopers, and Munroes, are all equally entitled
     to public approbation, particularly if we may credit the
     letters from the various persons who authenticate the
     miraculous cures they have performed in the most inveterate,
     we hail almost said, the most impossible, cases. If those
     persons are really in existence (and who can doubt it?) they
     certainly have occasion to be thankful for their escapes,
     and we congratulate them; for in our estimation Quack
     Doctors seem to consider the human frame merely as a subject
     for experiments, which if successful will secure the
     reputation of the practitioner. The acquisition of fame and
     fortune is, in the estimation of these philosophers, cheaply
     purchased by sacrificing the lives of a few of the vulgar,
     to whom they prescribe gratis; and the slavish obedience of
     some patients to the Doctor, is really astonishing. It is
     said that a convalescent at Bath wrote to his Physician in
     London, to know whether he might eat sauce with his pork;
     but we have not been able to discover whether he expected an
     answer gratis; that would perhaps have been an experiment
     not altogether grateful to the Doctor's feelings.

     The practice of advertising and billing the town has become
     so common, that a man scarcely opens a coal-shed, or a
     potatoe-stall, without giving due notice of it in the
     newspapers, and distributing hand-bills: and frequently with
     great success. But our Doctors, who make no show of their
     commodities, have no mode of making themselves known without
     it. Hence the quantity of bills thrust into the hand of the
     passenger through the streets of London, which divulge the
     almost incredible performances of their publishers. A high-
     sounding name, such as The Chevalier de diamant, the
     Chevalier de Ruspini, or The Medical Board, well bored behind
     and before, are perhaps more necessary, with a few paper
     puffs&mdash;as "palpable hits, my Lord," than either skill or
     practice, to obtain notice and secure fame.

     The Chevalier de Chamant, who was originally a box-maker,
     and a man of genius, considering box-making a plebeian
     occupation, was for deducing a logical position, not exactly
     perhaps by fair argument, but at all events through the
     teeth, and was determined, although he could not, like Dr.
     Pangloss, mend the cacology of his friends, at least to give
     them an opportunity for plenty of jaw-work. With this
     laudable object in view, he obtained a patent for making
     artificial teeth of mineral paste; and in his advertisements
     condescended not to prove their utility as substitutes for
     the real teeth, when decayed or wanting, (this was beneath
     his notice, and would have been a piece of mere plebeian
     Quackery unworthy of his great genius,) but absolutely
     assured the world that his mineral teeth were infinitely
     superior to any production of nature, both for mastication
     and beauty! How this was relished we know not; but he
     declared (and he certainly ought to know) that none but
     silly and timid persons would hesitate for one moment to
     have their teeth drawn, and substitute his minerals: and it
     is wonderful to relate, that although his charges were
     enormous, and the operation (as may be supposed) not the
     most pleasant, yet people could not resist the ingenious
     Chevalier's fascinating and drawing puffs; in consequence of
     which he soon became possessed of a large surplus of
     capital, with which he determined to speculate in the Funds.

     For this purpose he employed old Tom Bish, the Stockbroker,
     to purchase stock for the amount; but owing to a sudden
     fluctuation in the market, a considerable depreciation took
     place between the time of purchase and that of payment; a
     circumstance which made the Chevalier grin and show his
     teeth: Determining however, not to become a victim to the
     fangs of Bulls and Bears, but rather to dive like a duck, he
     declared the bargain was not legal, and that he would not be
     bound by it. Bish upon this occasion proved a hard-mouthed
     customer to the man of teeth, and was not a quiet subject to
     be drawn, but brought an action against the mineral monger,
     and recovered the debt. Tom's counsel, in stating the case,
     observed, that the Defendant would find the law could bite
     sharper aud hold tighter than any teeth he could make; and
     so it turned out.

     The Chevalier de R&mdash;sp&mdash;ni is another character who has cut
     no small figure in this line, but has recently made his
     appearance in the Gazette, not exactly on so happy an
     occasion as such a circumstance would be to his brother
     chip, Dr. D&mdash;n&mdash;ll, now (we suppose) Sir Francis&mdash;though
     perhaps equally entitled to the honour of knighthood. The
     Chevalier has for some years looked Royalty in the face by
     residing opposite Carlton House, and taken every precaution
     to let the public know that such an important public
     character was there to be found, by displaying his name as
     conspicuously as possible on brass plates, &amp;c. so that the
     visitors to Carlton House could hardly fail to notice him as
     the second greatest Character of that great neighbourhood.
     But what could induce so great a man to sport his figure in
     the Gazette, is as unaccountable as the means by which he
     obtained such happy celebrity. Had it occurred immediately
     after the war, it might have been concluded without much
     stretch of imagination, that the Chevalier, who prides
     himself on his intimacy with all the great men of the day,
     had, through the friendship of the Duke of Wellington, made
     a contract for the teeth and jaw-bones of all who fell at
     the battle of Waterloo, and that by bringing to market so
     great a stock at one time, the article had fallen in value,
     and left the speculating Chevalier so great a loser as to
     cause his bankruptcy. Whether such is the real cause or not,
     it is difficult to ascertain what could induce the Chevalier
     to descend from his dealings with the head to dabble with
     lower commodities.

     Among other modes of obtaining notoriety, usually resorted
     to by Empirics, the Chevalier used to job a very genteel
     carriage and pair, but his management was so excellent, that
     the expenses of his equipage were very trifling; for as it
     was not intended to run, but merely to stand at the door
     like a barker at a broker's shop, or a direction-post, he
     had the loan on very moderate terms, the job-master taking
     into account that the wind of the cattle was not likely to
     be injured, or the wheels rattled to pieces by velocity, or
     smashed by any violent concussion.

     The Chevalier had a Son, who unfortunately was not endowed
     by nature with so much ambition or information as his
     father; for, frequently when the carriage has been standing
     at the door, he has been seen drinking gin most cordially
     with Coachee, without once thinking of the evils of example,
     or recollecting that he was one of the family. Papa used to
     be very angry on these occasions, because, as he said, it
     was letting people know that Coachee was only hired as &amp;job,
     and not as a family domestic.

     For the great benefit and advantage of the community,
     Medical Boards have recently been announced in various parts
     of the Metropolis, where, according to the assertions of the
     Principals, in their advertisements, every disease incident
     to human nature is treated by men of skilful practice; and
     among these truly useful establishments, those of Drs.
     Cooper, Munro, and Co. of Charlotte house, Blackfriars, and
     Woodstock-house, Oxford-road, are not the least conspicuous.
     Who these worthies are, it   is   perhaps  difficult  to
     ascertain.      One   thing  however  is certain, that Sir
     F&mdash;&mdash;s C&mdash;&mdash;e D&mdash;n&mdash;ll, M.D. is announced as Treasurer,
     therefore there can be no doubt but that all is fair above
     board, for

          "Brutus is an honourable man,
          So are they all&mdash;all honourable men."

     And where so much skill derived from experience is
     exercised, it cannot be doubted but great and important
     benefits may result to a liberal and enlightened people. Of
     the establishment itself we are informed by a friend, that
     having occasion to call on the Treasurer, upon some
     business, the door was opened by a copper-coloured servant,
     a good-looking young Indian&mdash;not a fuscus Hydaspes, but a
     serving man of good appearance, who ushered him up stairs,
     and introduced him to the front room on the first floor,
     where all was quackery, bronze and brass, an electrical
     machine, images, pictures and diplomas framed and glazed,
     and a table covered with books and papers. In a short time,
     a person of very imposing appearance entered the room, with
     his hair profusely powdered, and his person, from his chin
     to his toes, enveloped in a sort of plaid roquelaure, who,
     apologizing for the absence of the Doctor, began to assure
     him of his being in the entire confidence of the Board, and
     in all probability would have proceeded to the operation of
     feeling the pulse in a very short time, had not the visitor
     discovered in the features of this disciple of Esculapius a
     person he had known in former times. 'Why, good God!'
     cried he, 'is that you?&mdash;What have you done with the Magic-
     lantern, and the Lecture on Heads?&mdash;am I right, or am I in
     fairy-land?' calling him by his name.    It was in vain to
     hesitate, it was impossible to escape, the discovery was
     complete. It was plain however that the dealer in magical
     delusions had not altogether given up the art of
     legerdemain, which, perhaps, he finds the most profitable of
     the two.

     Of the worthy Knight himself, (and perhaps the Coopers and
     Munros have been consumed by the electrical fluid of their
     own Board) much might be said. He is the inventor of a life-
     preserver, with which it may be fairly presumed he has
     effected valuable services to his country by the
     preservation of Royalty, as a proof of deserving the honour
     he has obtained. He is patriotic and independent, masonic
     and benevolent, a great admirer of fancy horses and fancy
     ladies, a curer of incurables, and has recently published
     one of the most extraordinary Memoirs that has ever been
     laid before the public, embellished with two portraits:
     which of the two is most interesting must be left to the
     discrimination of those who view them. It must however be
     acknowledged, that after reading the following extract,
     ingratitude is not yet eradicated from our nature, since,
     notwithstanding he has obtained the dignified appellation of
     Sir Francis, the Gazette says, that "in future no improper
     person shall be admitted to the honour of knighthood, in
     consequence of two surreptitious presentations lately"&mdash;the
     one an M.D. the other F.R.C. Surgeons, particularly if it
     were possible that this Gentleman may be one of the persons
     alluded to.    For, what says the Memoir?

     "The utility of Sir Francis's invention being thus fully
     established, and its ingenuity universally admired, it
     excited the interest of the first characters among the
     nobility, and an introduction to Court was repeatedly
     offered to Sir Francis on this account. After a previous
     communication with one of the Royal Family, and also with
     the Secretary of State, on the 14th June last, he had the
     honour of being presented to His Majesty, who, justly
     appreciating the merit of the discovery, was pleased to
     confer upon him the honour of knighthood.

     "Thus it is pleasing, in the distribution of honours by the
     hand of the Sovereign, to mark where they are conferred on
     real merit. This is the true intention of their origin; but
     it has been too often departed from, and they have been
     given where no other title existed than being the friend of
     those who had influence to gain the Royal ear.    From the
     above statement, it will be seen this honour was conferred
     on Sir Francis by his Majesty for an invention, which has
     saved since its discovery the lives of many hundreds, and
     which may be considered as having given the original idea to
     the similar inventions that have been attempted since that
     time. Its utility and importance we have also seen
     acknowledged and rewarded by the two leading Societies in
     this country, and perhaps in Europe, viz. the Royal Humane,
     and the Society of Arts. The Sovereign therefore was only
     recognizing merit which had been previously established; and
     the honour of knighthood, to the credit of the individual,
     was conferred by his Majesty in the most liberal and
     handsome manner, without any other influence being used by
     Sir Francis than simply preferring the claim."

     Thus the subject of Knighthood is to be nursed; and as the
     Doctor and the Nurse are generally to be recognized
     together, no one can read this part of the Memoir without
     exclaiming&mdash;Well done, Nussey. But why not Gazetted, after
     this liberal and hand-some manner of being rewarded? or why
     an allusion to two surreptitious presentations, the names of
     which two persons, so pointedly omitted, cannot well be
     misunderstood? This is but doing things by halves, though no
     such an observation can be applied to the proceedings of
     Charlotte-house, where Cooper, Munro, and Co. (being well
     explained) means two or three persons, viz. a black, a white
     man, and a mahogany-coloured Knight&mdash;a barber by trade, and
     a skinner by company&mdash;a dealer in mercurials&mdash;a puff by
     practice and an advertiser well versed in all the arts of
     his prototype&mdash;a practitioner in panygyric&mdash;the puff direct&mdash;
     the puff preliminary&mdash;the puff collateral&mdash;the puff
     collusive&mdash;and the puff oblique, or puff by implication.
     Whether this will apply to Sir Charles Althis or not, is
     perhaps not so easy to ascertain; but as birds of a feather
     like to flock together, so these medical Knights in
     misfortune deserve to be noticed in the same column,
     although the one is said to be a Shaver, and the other a
     Quaker. It seems they have both been moved by the same
     spirit, and both follow (a good way off) the profession of
     medicine.

     Among the various improvements of these improving times, for
     we are still improving, notwithstanding complaint, a learned
     little Devil, inflated with gas, has suggested a plan for
     the establishment of a Medical Assurance-office, where
     person and property might be insured at so much per annum,
     and the advantages to be derived from such an Institution
     would be, that instead of the insurance increasing with
     years, it would grow less and less. How many thousand
     grateful patients would it relieve annually! but we fear it
     would be a daily source of sorrow to these knightly
     medicals, and would by them be considered a devilish hard
     case.
</pre>
<p>
But hush, here is other company, and I will give you an account of him
as we go along."
</p>
<p>
They now attended the Keeper, who explained the age, height, weight,
species, size, power, and propensities of the animal, and then departed
on their road towards Temple Bar,&mdash;on passing through which, they were
overtaken again by Sir Francis, in a gig drawn by a dun-coloured
horse, with his puppy between his legs, and a servant by his side, and
immediately renewed the previous conversation.
</p>
<p>
"There he goes again," said Sparkle, "and a rare fellow he is too."
</p>
<p>
"I should think so," said Bob; "he must have quacked to some good
purpose, to obtain the honour of knighthood."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>"Not positively that," continued Sparkle; "for to obtain and to
deserve are not synonymous, and, if report say true, there is not much
honour attached to his obtaining it.
</p>
<p>
"&mdash;&mdash;In the modesty of fearful duty,
</p>
<pre>
          I read as much as from the rattling tongue
          Of saucy and audacious eloquence:
          Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity,
          At least speak most to my capacity."
</pre>
<p>
And, according to my humble conception, he who talks much about himself,
or pays others to talk or write about him, is generally most likely to
be least deserving of public patronage; for if a man possesses real and
evident abilities in any line of profession, the public will not be
long in making a discovery of its existence, and the bounty, as is most
usually the case, would quickly follow upon the heels of approbation.
But many a meritorious man in the Metropolis is pining away his
miserable existence, too proud to beg, and too honest to steal, while
others, with scarcely more brains than a sparrow, by persevering in
a determination to leave no stone unturned to make themselves appear
ridiculous, as a first step to popularity; and having once excited
attention, even though it is merely to be laughed at by the thinking
part of mankind, he finds it no great difficulty to draw the money out
of their pockets while their eyes are riveted on a contemplation of his
person or conduct. And there are not wanting instances of effrontery
that have elevated men of little or no capacity to dignified situations.
If report say true, the present Secretary of the Admiralty, who is
admirable for his poetry also, was originally a hair-dresser, residing
somewhere in Blackfriar's or Westminster-road; but then you must
recollect he was a man who knew it was useless to lose a single
opportunity; and probably such has been the case with Sir Daniel
Harlequin, who, from keeping a small shop in Wapping, making a blaze
upon the water about his Life-preserver, marrying a wife with a red
face and a full pocket, retired to a small cottage at Mile End, and
afterwards establishing a Medical Board, has got himself dubbed a
Knight. To be sure he has had a deal of puffing and blowing work to get
through in his progress, which probably accounts for his black looks,
not a little increased by the quantity of powder he wears. But what have
we here?" finding the bustle of the streets considerably increased after
passing Temple Bar.
</p>
<p>
"Some political Bookseller or other, in all probability," said
Tom&mdash;"I'll step forward and see." And in passing through the numerous
body of persons that crowded on every side, the whole party was
separated. Bob, who had hung a little back while his two friends rushed
forward, was lingering near the corner of the Temple: he was beckoned by
a man across the way, to whom he immediately went.
</p>
<p>
"Do you happen to want a piece of fine India silk handkerchiefs, Sir?
I have some in my pocket that I can recommend and sell cheap&mdash;for money
must be had; but only keep it to yourself, because they are smuggled
goods, of the best quality and richest pattern." During this opening
speech, he was endeavouring to draw Tallyho under the archway of
Bell-yard, when Sparkle espying him, ran across to him, and taking him
by the arm&mdash;"Come along (said he;) and if you don't take yourself off
instantly, I'll put you in custody," shaking his stick at the other.
</p>
<p>
All this was like Hebrew to Bob, who, for his part, really conceived the
poor fellow, as he termed him, might be in want of money, and compelled
to dispose of his article for subsistence.
</p>
<p>
"Ha, ha, ha," cried Sparkle, "I see you know nothing about them: these
are the locusts of the town." At this moment they were joined by the
Hon. Tom Dashall.
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" continued Sparkle, "I just saved your Cousin from being
trepanned, and sent for a soldier."
</p>
<p>
Tallyho appeared all amazement.
</p>
<p>
"What," cried Tom, "in the wars of Venus then, I suppose I know he has a
fancy for astronomy, and probably he was desirous of taking a peep into
Shire-lane, where he might easily find the Sun, Moon, and Seven Stars."
</p>
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" replied Sparkle, "not exactly so; but I rescued him from
the hands of a Buffer,{1} who would
</p>
<pre>
     1 Buffers miscalled Duffers&mdash;Persons who adopt a species of
     swindling which is rather difficult of detection, though it
     is daily practised in London. The term Buffer takes its
     derivation from a custom which at one time prevailed of
     carrying Bandanas, sarsnets, French stockings, and silk of
     various kinds, next the shirts of the sellers; so that upon
     making a sale, they were obliged to undress in order to come
     at the goods, or in other words, to strip to the skin, or
     buff it; by which means they obtained the title of Buffers.
     This trade (if it may be so termed) is carried on in a
     genteel manner. The parties go about from house to house,
     and attend public-houses, inns, and fairs, pretending to
     sell smuggled goods, such as those already mentioned; and by
     offering their goods for sale, they are enabled by practice
     to discover the proper objects for their arts.

     Buffers, or Duffers, who are not rogues in the strict sense
     of the word, only offer to sell their goods to the best
     advantage, and by this means evade the detection of the
     police, but are equally subversive or destructive of common
     honesty under a cloak or disguise; for if they can persuade
     any person that the article offered is actually better or
     cheaper than any other person's, they are doing no more than
     every tradesman does; but then as they pay no rent or taxes
     to the State, the principal objection to them lies in the
     mode of operation, and an overstrained recommendation of
     their goods, which are always, according to their account,
     of the most superior quality; and they have a peculiar
     facility of discovering the novice or the silly, to whom
     walking up with a serious countenance and interesting air,
     they broach the pleasing intelligence, that they have on
     sale an excellent article well worth their attention, giving
     a caution at the same time, that honour and secrecy must be
     implicitly observed, or it may lead to unpleasantness to
     both parties. By these means persons from the country are
     frequently enticed into public-houses to look at their
     goods; and if they do not succeed in one way, they are
     almost sure in another, by having an accomplice, who will
     not fail to praise the articles for sale, and propose some
     gambling scheme, by which the party is plundered of his
     money by passing forged Bank-notes, base silver or copper,
     in the course of their dealings.

"The mob you see collected there," said the Hon. Tom Dashalll, "is
attracted by two circumstances&mdash;Money's new Coronation Crop, just
lanched&mdash;and a broken image of a Highlander, at the door of a
snuff-shop; each of them truly important and interesting of course, the
elevation of one man, and the destruction of another. The poor Scotchman
seems dreadfully bruised, and I suppose is now under the Doctor's hands,
for he has two or three plasters on his face."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," continued Sparkle, "he has been out on a spree,{1} had a bit of a
turn-up, and been knock'd down."

Upon hearing this conversation, Tallyho could not help inquiring into
the particulars.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>Sparkle&mdash;"in London, as you perceive, tradesmen are in the habit
of exhibiting signs of the business or profession in which they are
engaged. The Pawnbroker decorates his door with three gold balls&mdash;the
Barber, in some places, (though it is a practice almost out of date)
hangs out a long pole&mdash;the Gold-beater, an arm with a hammer in the
act of striking&mdash;the Chemist, a head of Glauber, or Esculapius&mdash;the
Tobacconist, a roll of tobacco, and of late it has become customary
for these venders of pulverised atoms called snuff, to station a wooden
figure of a Highlander, in the act of taking a pinch of Hardham's, or
High-dried, as a sort of inviting introduction to their counters; and
a few nights back, a Scotchman, returning from his enjoyments at a
neighbouring tavern, stopped to have a little friendly chat with this
gentleman's Highlander, and by some means or other, I suppose, a quarrel
ensued, upon which the animated young Scotchman took advantage of his
countryman&mdash;floored him, broke both his arms, and otherwise did him
considerable bodily injury, the effects of which are still visible;
and Johnny Bull, who is fond of a little gape-seed, is endeavouring to
console him under his sufferings."
</p>
<p>
"Very kind of him, indeed," replied Bob.
</p>
<p>
"At any rate," said Tom, "the Tobacconist will have occasion to be
grateful to the Highlander{1} for some portion of his popularity."
</p>
<pre>
     1 It is matter of astonishment to some, but not less true,
     that many tradesmen in the Metropolis have to ascribe both
     fame and fortune to adventitious circumstances. It is said
     that Hardham, of Fleet Street, had to thank the celebrated
     Comedian, Foote, who, in one of his popular characters,
     introducing his snuffbox, offered a pinch to the person he
     was in conversation with on the stage, who spoke well of it,
     and inquired where he obtained it?&mdash;"Why, at Hardham's, to
     be sure." And to this apparently trifling circumstance,
     Hardham was indebted for his fortune.

     The importance of a Highlander to a snuff-shop will appear
     by a perusal of the following fact:&mdash;

     A very respectable young man, a Clerk in the office of an
     eminent Solicitor, was recently brought before Mr. Alderman
     Atkins, upon the charge of being disorderly. The prisoner,
     it seemed, on his return home from a social party, where he
     had been sacrificing rather too freely to the jolly god, was
     struck with the appearance of a showy wooden figure of a
     Highlander, at the door of Mr. Micklan's snuff-shop, No. 12,
     Fleet Street. The young Attorney, who is himself a
     Scotchman, must needs claim acquaintance with his
     countryman. He chucked him familiarly under the chin, called
     him a very pretty fellow, and,  in the vehemence of his
     affection, embraced him with so much violence, as to force
     him from his station. Mr. Micklan ran to the assistance of
     his servant, and in the scuffle the unfortunate Highlander
     had both his arms dislocated, the frill that adorned his
     neck damaged, besides other personal injuries, which his
     living countryman not being in the humour to atone for, Mr.
     Micklau gave him in charge to the watchman. Before the
     Magistrate in the morning, the young man appeared heartily
     sick of his folly, and perfectly willing to make every
     reparation, but complained of the excessive demand, which he
     stated to be no less than thirteen guineas. Mr. Micklan
     produced the remains of the unfortunate Highlander, who
     excited a compound fracture of both arms, with a mutilation
     of three or four fingers, and such other bodily wounds, as
     to render his perfect recovery, so as to resume his
     functions at Mr. Micklan's door, altogether hopeless. The
     Highlander, the complainant stated, cost him thirteen
     guineas, and was entirely new. The sum might seem large for
     the young gentleman to pay for such a frolic, but it would
     not compensate him for the injury he should sustain by the
     absence of the figure; for, however strange it might appear,
     he did not hesitate to say, that without it he should not
     have more than half his business. Since he had stationed it
     at his door, he had taken on an average thirty shillings a
     day more than he had done previous to exhibiting his
     attractions.

     There being no proof of a breach of the peace, Mr. Alderman
     Atkins advised the gentleman to settle the matter upon the
     best terms he could. They withdrew together, and on their
     return the complainant reported that the gentleman had
     agreed to take the figure, and furnish him with a new one.

     Mr. Alderman Atkins, in discharging the prisoner,
     recommended to him to get the figure repaired, and make a
     niche for him in his office, where, by using it as a proper
     memorial, it would probably save him more than it cost him.

     The broken figure has since been exhibited in his old
     station, and excited considerable notice; but we apprehend
     he is not yet able to afford all the attractions of his
     occupation, for he has formerly been seen inviting his
     friends to a pinch of snuff gratis, by holding a box
     actually containing that recreating powder in his hand, in
     the most obliging and condescending manner&mdash;a mark of
     politeness and good breeding well worthy of respectful
     attention.

"Come," said Sparkle, "we are now in one of the principal thoroughfares
of the Metropolis, Fleet Street, of which you have already heard much,
and is at all times thronged with multitudes of active and industrious
persons, in pursuit of their various avocations, like a hive of bees,
and keeping up, like them, a ceaseless hum. Nor is it less a scene of
Real Life worth viewing, than the more refined haunts of the noble, the
rich, and the great, many of whom leave their splendid habitations in
the West in the morning, to attend the money-getting, <span class="pagenum">[113]</span>commercial
men of the City, and transact their business.&mdash;The dashing young
spendthrift, to borrow at any interest; and the more prudent, to buy or
to sell. The plodding tradesman, the ingenious mechanic, are exhausting
their time in endeavours to realize property, perhaps to be left for
the benefit of a Son, who as ardently sets about, after his Father's
decease, to get rid of it&mdash;nay, perhaps, pants for an opportunity of
doing this before he can take possession; for the young Citizen, having
lived just long enough to conceive himself superior to his father, in
violation of filial duty and natural authority, affects an aversion to
every thing that is not novel, expensive, and singular. He is a lad of
high spirit; he calls the city a poor dull prison, in which he cannot
bear to be confined; and though he may not intend to mount his nag,
stiffens his cravat, whistles a sonata, to which his whip applied to the
boot forms an accompaniment; while his spurs wage war with the flounces
of a fashionably-dressed belle, or come occasionally in painful contact
with the full-stretched stockings of a gouty old gentleman; by all
which he fancies he is keeping" up the dignity and importance of his
character. He does not slip the white kid glove from his hand without
convincing the spectator that; his hand is the whiter skin; nor
twist his fingers for the introduction of a pinch of Maccaba, without
displaying to the best advantage his beautifully chased ring and
elegantly painted snuff-box lid; nor can the hour of the day be
ascertained without discovering his engine-turned repeater, and hearing
its fascinating music: then the fanciful chain, the precious stones
in golden robes, and last of all, the family pride described in true
heraldic taste and naïveté. Of Peter Pindar's opinion, that
</p>
<pre>
          "Care to our coffin adds a nail,
          But every grin so merry draws one out,"
</pre>
<p>
he thinks it an admirable piece of politeness and true breeding to give
correct specimens of the turkey or the goose in the serious scenes of a
dramatic representation, or while witnessing her Ladyship's confusion
in a crowd of carriages combating for precedence in order to obtain
an early appearance at Court. Reading he considers quite a bore, but
attends the reading-room, which he enters, not to know what is worth
reading and add a little knowledge to his slender stock from the labours
and experience of <span class="pagenum">[114]</span>men of letters&mdash;no, but to quiz the cognoscenti,
and throw the incense over its learned atmosphere from his strongly
perfumed cambric handkerchief, which also implies what is most in
use for the indulgence of one of the five senses. When he enters a
coffee-room, it is not for the purpose of meeting an old friend, and to
enjoy with him a little rational conversation over his viands, but
to ask for every newspaper, and throw them aside without looking at
them&mdash;to call the Waiter loudly by his name, and shew his authority&mdash;to
contradict an unknown speaker who is in debate with others, and declare,
upon the honour of a gentleman and the veracity of a scholar, that Pope
never understood Greek, nor translated Homer with tolerable justice.
He considers it a high privilege to meet a celebrated pugilist at an
appointed place, to floor him for a quid,{1} a fall, and a high delight
to talk of it afterwards for the edification of his friends&mdash;to pick
up a Cyprian at mid-day&mdash;to stare modest women out of countenance&mdash;to
bluster at a hackney-coachman&mdash;or to upset a waterman in the river, in
order to gain the fame of a Leander, and prove himself a Hero.

<p>
"He rejects all his father's proposed arrangements for his domestic
comforts and matrimonial alliance. He wanders in his own capricious
fancy, like a fly in summer, over the fields of feminine beauty and
loveliness; yet he declares there is so much versatility and instability
about the fair sex, that they are unworthy his professions of regard;
and, perhaps, in his whole composition, there is nothing deserving of
serious notice but his good-nature. Thus you have a short sketch of a
young Citizen."
</p>
<p>
"Upon my word, friend Sparkle, you are an admirable delineator of
Society," said Dashall.
</p>
<p>
"My drawings are made from nature," continued Sparkle.
</p>
<p>
"Aye, and very naturally executed too," replied Tom. Having kept walking
on towards St. Paul's, they were by this time near the end of Shoe Lane,
at the corner of which sat an elderly woman with a basket of mackerel
for sale; and as they approached they saw several persons rush from
thence into the main street in evident alarm.
</p>
<p>
"Come up, d&mdash;&mdash;n your eyes," said an ill-favoured fellow with an
immense cudgel in his fist, driving an ass laden
</p>
<pre>
     1 Quid&mdash;A. Guinea.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>with brick-dust, with which he was belabouring him most
unmercifully. The poor beast, with an endeavour to escape if possible
the cudgelling which awaited him, made a sudden turn round the post,
rubbing his side against it as he went along, and thereby relieving
himself of his load, which he safely deposited, with a cloud of
brick-dust that almost blinded the old woman and those who were near
her, in the basket of fish. Neddy then made the best of his way towards
Fleet-market, and an over-drove bullock, which had terrified many
persons, issued almost at the same moment from Shoe Lane, and took the
direction for Temple-bar. The whistling, the hooting, the hallooing,
and the running of the drovers in pursuit&mdash;men, women, and children,
scampering to get out of the way of the infuriated beast&mdash;the noise and
rattling of carriages, the lamentations of the poor fish-fag, and the
vociferations of the donkey-driver to recover his neddy&mdash;together with a
combination of undistinguishable sounds from a variety of voices, crying
their articles for sale, or announcing their several occupations&mdash;formed
a contrast of characters, situations, and circumstances, not easily to
be described. Here, a poor half-starved and almost frightened-to-death
brat of a Chimney-sweeper, in haste to escape, had run against a lady
whose garments were as white as snow&mdash;there, a Barber had run against
a Parson, and falling along with him, had dropped a pot of pomatum from
his apron-pocket on the reverend gentleman's eye, and left a mark in
perfect unison with the colour of his garments before the disaster, but
which were now of a piebald nature, neither black nor white. A barrow
of nuts, overturned in one place, afforded fine amusement for the
scrambling boys and girls&mdash;a Jew old clothes-man swore upon his
conscience he had losht the pest pargain vhat he ever had offered to him
in all his lifetime, by dem tam'd bears of bull-drivers&mdash;a Sailor called
him a gallows <i>half-hung ould crimp</i>,{1} d&mdash;&mdash;d his
</p>
<pre>
     1 Crimp&mdash;Kidnappers, Trappers, or Procurers of men for the
     Merchant Service; and the East-India company contract with
     them for a supply of sailors to navigate their ships out and
     home. These are for the most part Jews, who have made
     advances to the sailors of money, clothes, victuals, and
     lodgings, generally to a very small amount, taking care to
     charge an enormous price for every article. The poor
     fellows, by these means, are placed under a sort of
     espionage, if not close confinement, till the ship is ready
     to receive them; and then they are conducted on board at
     Gravesend by the Crimp and his assistants, and  a receipt
     taken  for them.

     In this process there is nothing very reprehensible&mdash;the men
     want births, and have no money&mdash;the Crimp keeps a lodging-
     house, and wishes to be certain of his man: he therefore
     takes him into the house, and after a very small supply of
     cash, the grand do, is to persuade him to buy watches,
     buckles, hats, and jackets, to be paid for on his receiving
     his advance previous to sailing. By this means and the
     introduction of grog, the most barefaced and unblushing
     robberies have been committed.

     With the same view of fleecing the unwary poor fellows, who

          "... at sea earn their money like horses,
          To squander it idly like asses on shore,"

     they watch their arrival after the voyage, and advance small
     sums of money upon their tickets, or perhaps buy them out
     and out, getting rid at the same time of watches, jewellery,
     and such stuff, at more than treble their real value. Not
     only is this the case in London, but at all the out-ports it
     is practised to a very great extent, particularly in war
     time.

     Happy would it be for poor Jack were this all; he is some-
     times brought in indebted to the Crimp to a large nominal
     amount, by what is called a long-shore attorney, or more
     appropriately, a black shark, and thrown into jail!!! There
     he lies until his body is wanted, and then the incarcerator
     négociâtes with him for his liberty, to be permitted to
     enter on board again.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>eyes if he was not glad of it, and, with a sling of his arm,
deposited an enormous quid he had in his mouth directly in the chaps
of the Israelite, then joined the throng in pursuit; while the Jew,
endeavouring to call Stop thief, took more of the second-hand quid
than agreed with the delicacy of his stomach, and commenced a vomit,
ejaculating with woful lamentations, that he had lost his bag mit all
his propertish.
</p>
<p>
The old mackarel-woman, seeing her fish covered with brick-dust, set off
in pursuit of the limping donkey-driver, and catching him by the neck,
swore he should pay her for the fish, and brought him back to the scene
of action; but, in the mean time, the Street-keeper had seized
and carried off the basket with all its contents&mdash;misfortune upon
misfortune!
</p>
<p>
"D&mdash;&mdash;n your ass, and you too," said the Fish-woman, "if you doesn't
pay me for my fish, I'll <i>quod</i>{1} you&mdash;that there's all vat I ar got to
say."

Neddy?"
</p>
<p>
"Vhat, you thinks you are a <i>flat-catching</i>,{1} do you, Limping
Billy&mdash;but eh, who has run away with my basket offish?"
</p>
<p>
"Ha, ha, ha," cried Limping Billy, bursting into a horse-laugh at the
additional distress of the old woman, in which he was joined by many of
the surrounding spectators; and which so enraged her, that she let go
her hold, and bursting through the crowd with an irresistible strength,
increased almost to the fury of madness by her additional loss, she ran
some paces distance in search of, not only her stock in trade, but
her shop, shop-board, and working-tools; while the donkey-driver
boisterously vociferated after her&mdash;"Here they are six a shilling, live
mackarel O."
</p>
<p>
This taunt of the brick-dust merchant was too much to be borne, and
brought her back again with a determination to chastise him, which she
did in a summary way, by knocking him backwards into the kennel. Billy
was not pleased at this unexpected salute, called her a drunken &mdash;&mdash;,
and endeavoured to get out of her way&mdash;"for," said he, "I know she is a
b&mdash;&mdash;dy rum customer when she gets lushy."{2} At this moment, a sturdy
youth, about sixteen or seventeen years of age, was seen at a short
distance riding the runaway-ass back again. Billy perceiving this,
became a little more reconciled to his rough usage&mdash;swore he never would
strike a voman, so help him G&mdash;&mdash;d, for that he was a man every inch of
him; and as for Mother Mapps, he'd be d&mdash;&mdash;nd-if he vouldn't treat her
with all the pleasure of life; and now he had got his own ass, he vould
go along with her for to find her mackarel. Then shaking a cloud of
brick-dust from the dry parts of his apparel, with sundry portions of
mud from those parts which had most easily reached the kennel, he took
the bridle of his donkey, and bidding her come along, they toddled{3}
together to a gin-shop in Shoe Lane.
</p>
<pre>
     1 Flat-catching&mdash;Is an expression of very common use, and
     seems almost to explain itself, being the act of taking
     advantage of any person who appears ignorant and

     3  Toddle&mdash;To toddle is to walk slowly, either from

Sparkle, "they'll all be in prime twig presently, and we shall have some

</pre>
<p>
Hark, (said he) there's a fiddle-scraper in the house&mdash;here goes;" and
immediately they entered.
</p>
<p>
They had no occasion to repent of their movements; for in one corner
of the tap-room sat Billy Waters, a well-known character about town,
a Black Man with a wooden leg was fiddling to a Slaughterman from
Fleet-market, in wooden shoes, who, deck'd with all the paraphernalia of
his occupation, a greasy jacket and night-cap, an apron besmeared with
mud, blood, and grease, nearly an inch thick, and a leathern girdle,
from which was suspended a case to hold his knives, and his sleeves
tuck'd up as if he had but just left the slaughter-house, was dancing in
the centre to the infinite amusement of the company, which consisted of
an old woman with periwinkles and crabs for sale in a basket&mdash;a porter
with his knot upon the table&mdash;a dustman with his broad-flapped hat, and
his bell by his side&mdash;an Irish hodman&mdash;and two poor girls, who appeared
to be greatly taken with the black fiddler, whose head was decorated
with an oil-skinned cock'd hat, and a profusion of many coloured
feathers: on the other side of the room sat a young man of
shabby-genteel appearance, reading the newspaper with close attention,
and purring forth volumes of smoke. Limping Billy and Mother Mapps were
immediately known, and room was made for their accommodation, while the
fiddler's elbow and the slaughterman's wooden shoes were kept in motion.
</p>
<p>

<p>
"Vat's the reason I an't to have a pipe?" said Mother Mapps.

<p>
"Lord bless your heart," said the Donkey-driver, "if I did'nt forget
you, never trust me&mdash;here, Landlord, a pipe for this here Lady."
</p>
<p>
"Which way did the bull run?" said the Irishman.
</p>
<p>
"Bl&mdash;&mdash;st me if I know," replied Limping Billy, "for I was a
looking out for my own ass&mdash;let's have the Sprig of Shelalah, <i>ould

</p>
<p>
The old woman being supplied with a pipe, and the fiddler having rosined
his nerves with a glass of <i>blue ruin</i>{3} to it they went, some singing,
some whistling, and others drumming with their hands upon the table;
while Tom, Bob, and Sparkle, taking a seat at the other side of
the room, ordered a glass of brandy and water each, and enjoyed the
merriment of the scene before them, perhaps more than those actually
engaged in it. Bob was alive to every movement and every character, for
it was new, and truly interesting: and kept growing more so, for in a
few minutes Limping Billy and Mother Mapps joined the Slaughterman in
the dance, when nothing could be more grotesque and amusing. Their pipes
in their mouths&mdash;clapping of hands and snapping of fingers, formed a
curious accompaniment to the squeaking of the fiddle&mdash;the broad grin of

gin&mdash;more music, and more tobacco, soon ad a visible effect upon the
party, and reeling became unavoidable. The young man reading the paper,
found it impossible to understand what he was perusing, and having
finished his pipe and his pint, made his exit, appearing to have no
relish for the entertainment, and perhaps heartily cursing both the
cause and the effect. Still, however, the party was not reduced in
number, for as one went out another came in.
</p>
<p>
This new customer was a young-looking man, bearing a large board on a
high pole, announcing the residence of a Bug-destroyer in the Strand.
His appearance was grotesque in the extreme, and could only be equalled
by the eccentricities of his manners and conversation. He was dressed
in a brown coat, close buttoned, over which he had a red camlet or stuff
surtout, apparently the off-cast of some theatrical performer, but with
a determination to appear fashionable; for

<pre>
          "Folks might as well be dead&mdash;nay buried too,
          As not to dress and act as others do."
</pre>
<p>
He wore mustachios, a pair of green spectacles, and his whole figure was
surmounted with a fur-cap. Taking a seat directly opposite our party
at the same table&mdash;"Bring me a pint," said he; and then deliberately
searching his pockets, he produced a short pipe and some tobacco, with
which he filled it&mdash;"You see," said he, "I am obliged to smoke according
to the Doctor's orders, for an asthma&mdash;so I always smokes three pipes a
day, that's my allowance; but I can eat more than any man in the room,
and can dance, sing, and act&mdash;nothing conies amiss to me, all the
players takes their characters from me."
</p>
<p>
After this introduction&mdash;"You are a clever fellow, I'll be bound for
it," said Dashall.
</p>
<p>
"O yes, I acts Richard the Third sometimes&mdash;sometimes Macbeth and
Tom Thumb. I have played before Mr. Kean: then I acted Richard the
Third&mdash;'Give me a horse! '&mdash;(starting into the middle of the room)&mdash;'no,
stop, not so&mdash;let me see, let me see, how is it?&mdash;ah, this is the
way&mdash;Give me a horse&mdash;Oh! Oh! Oh!&mdash;then you know I dies."&mdash;And down he
fell on the floor, which created a general roar of laughter; while
Billy Waters <span class="pagenum">[121]</span>struck up, "See the conquering Hero conies!" to the
inexpressible delight of all around him&mdash;their feet and hands all going
at the same time.

Limping Billy was also evidently in <i>queer-street</i>.

<p>
"Come," said Sparkle, "won't you have a drop more?"
</p>
<p>
"Thank ye, Sir," was the reply; and Sparkle, intent upon having his
gig out, ordered a fresh supply, which soon revived the fallen hero of
Bosworth-field, and Richard was himself again.

"Now," said he, "I'll sing you a song," and immediately commenced as
follows:&mdash;

         "My name's Hookey Walker, I'm known very well,
         In acting and eating I others excel;
         The player-folks all take their patterns from me,
         And a nice pattern too!&mdash;Don't you see? don't you see?
         Oh! [<i>glancing at his fingers</i>] It will do&mdash;it will do.

         At Chippenham born, I was left quite forlorn,
         When my father was dead and my mother was gone;
         So I came up to London, a nice little he,
         And a nice pattern too!&mdash;Don't you see? don't you see?
         Oh! it will do&mdash;it will do.

         A courting I went to a girl in our court,
         She laugh'd at my figure, and made me her sport;
         I was cut to the soul,&mdash;so said I on my knee,
         I'm a victim of love!&mdash;Don't you see? don't you see?
         Oh! it won't do&mdash;it won't do.

         Now all day I march to and fro in the street,
         And a candle sometimes on my journey I eat;
         So I'll set you a pattern, if you'll but agree,
         And a nice pattern too! you shall see&mdash;you shall see.
         Oh! it will do&mdash;it will do."

This Song, which he declared was all <i>made out of his own head</i>, was
sung with grotesque action and ridiculous grimace, intended no doubt in
imitation of Mr. Wilkinson in his inimitable performance of this strange
piece of whimsicality. The dancing party was knock'd up and were lobbing
their <i>lollys</i>,{1} half asleep and half awake, on the table, bowing as
it were to the magnanimous influence

<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>of <i>Old Tom</i>.{1} The Dustman and the Irishman laugh'd heartily;
and Das hall, Tallyho, and Sparkle, could not resist the impulse
to risibility when they contemplated the group before them. The
Bug-destroyer <i>munched</i>{2} a candle and <i>sluiced</i>{3} his greasy
<i>chops</i>{4} with <i>Jacky</i>{5} almost as fast as they could supply him
with it, when Sparkle perceiving the boy was still at the door with the
runaway ass,
</p>
<p>
"Come," said he, "we'll start 'em off home in high style&mdash;here, you Mr.
Bugman, can you ride?"
</p>
<p>
"Ride, aye to be sure I can, any of Mr. Astley's horses as well as the
Champion of England,"{6} was the reply.

<pre>
     1  Old Tom&mdash;It is customary in public-houses and gin-shops
     in London and its vicinity to exhibit a cask inscribed with

     6 Any person would almost suspect that Hookey had been
     reading the newspapers by this allusion; but that certainly
     could not be the case, for, spurning all education in early
     life, this representative of the immortal bard&mdash;this
     character of characters from Shakespeare, could neither read
     nor write, but made all he acted, as he said, from his own
     head: however, it may fairly be presumed, that in the course
     of his travels during the day he had heard something of the
     Champion intended to appear at the approaching Coronation,
     of whom the following account has recently been circulated
     through the daily press, and, with his usual consistency,
     conceived his own innate abilities equal to those which
     might be acquired by Mr. Dymocke, though his claims were not
     equally honourable or advantageous.

     Mr. Dymocke, the nephew of the gentleman (who is a
     Clergyman) entitled by hereditary right to do the service of
     the Champion to his Majesty, is still in hopes he may be
     permitted to act under his Uncle's nomination, although he
     wants a few months of being of age. A petition is before the
     King on the subject; and Mr. Dymocke, by constant practice
     at Astley's Hiding-school, is endeavouring to qualify
     himself for the due fulfilment of the office. On Thursday
     lie went through his exercise in a heavy suit of armour with
     great celerity. The horse which will be rode by the Champion
     has been selected from Mr. Astley's troop. It is a fine
     animal, pieballed black and white, and is regularly
     exercised in the part he will have to perform.
</pre>
<p>
"Walk in&mdash;walk in, Ladies and Gentlemen, just going to begin&mdash;come, Mr.
Merryman, all ready&mdash;Ladies and Gentlemen, please to observe, this here
horse is not that there horse."

<p>
"So we laugh at John Bull a little."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>"Come, then," continued Sparkle, "another glass&mdash;half-a-crown to
ride to the bottom of the lane and up Holboru-hill on that donkey at the
door, and you shall be our Champion."
</p>
<p>
"A bargain&mdash;a bargain," said the assumed Hookey Walker, rubbing the
tallow from his <i>gills</i>.{1}
</p>
<p>
"Here goes then," said Sparkle; then slipping half-a-crown into the
boy's hand, desiring him to run as far as the Traveller-office, in
Fleet-street, and get him a newspaper, promising to take care of his
ass till his return. The lad nibbled the bait, and was off in a <i>pig's
whisper</i>{2} Sparkle called to Tom and Bob, and putting them up to
his scheme, Hookey was quickly mounted, while Dashall and his Cousin,
assisted by the Hibernian and Dust-ho, succeeded in getting Mother Mapps
out, who was placed in the front of the Champion, astride, with her face
towards him and Limping Billy, who though <i>beat to a stand still</i>,{3}
was after some difficulty lifted up behind. Hookey was then supplied
with his board, the pole of which he placed on his foot, in the manner
of a spear or lance. Then giving the Irishman and the Dustman some
silver, to act as Supporters or Esquires, one on each side, they
proceeded along Shoe-lane, preceded by Billy Waters flourishing his
wooden-leg and feathers, and fiddling as he went&mdash;the Irishman roaring
out with Stentorian lungs,

<pre>
          "Sure won't you hear
          What roaring cheer
          Was spread at Paddy's wedding O,
          And how so gay
          They spent the day,

"<i>Kim ap</i>&mdash;be after sitting fast in the front there, old Mapps, or

turning to the right, very soon regained Fleet-Street, laughing heartily

well satisfied with their spree.

Engaged in conversation upon this adventure, they found nothing of
interest' or amusement to attract their notice till they arrived at the
warehouse of the London Genuine Tea Company, except merely remarking the
grand appearance of St. Paul's, from that situation.
</p>
<p>
"Genuine tea" said Bob; "what can that mean&mdash;Is tea any thing but tea?"
</p>
<p>
"To be sure it is," said Sparkle, "or has been&mdash;<i>any</i>thing but tea,"{l}
strongly marking the latter part of the

     1 Tea and Coffee&mdash;The adulteration of articles of human food
     is a practice of the most nefarious description, and cannot
     be too strongly deprecated, although it has been carried to
     an alarming extent. There is scarcely an article of ordinary
     consumption but has been unlawfully adulterated, and in many
     cases rendered injurious by the infamous and fraudulent
     practice of interested persons. Bread, which is considered
     to be the staff of life, and beer and ale the universal
     beverage of the people of this country, are known to be
     frequently mixed with drugs of the most pernicious quality.
     Gin, that favourite and heart-inspiring cordial of the lower
     orders of society, that it may have the grip, or the
     appearance of being particularly strong, is frequently
     adulterated with the decoction of long pepper, or a small
     quantity of aqua-fortis, a deadly poison. Sugar has been
     known to be mixed with sand; and tobacco, for the public-
     houses, undergoes a process for making it strong and
     intoxicating; but the recent discovery of the nefarious
     practice of adulterating tea and coffee, articles of the
     most universal and extensive consumption, deserves
     particular reprehension.

     Tea has been adulterated by the introduction of dried sloe
     leaves; the practice is not very new, but its extensive
     adoption, and the deleterious properties ascribed to them by
     physicians, have been, at length, successfully exposed by
     the conviction of many of the venders, so, it is hoped, as
     to prevent a repetition of the crime. The sloe leaf, though
     a spurious commodity when sold as tea, might afford a
     harmless vegetable infusion, and be recommended to the poor
     and frugal as a cheap succedaneum for the Chinese vegetable.
     The establishment of the Genuine Tea Company on Ludgate-hill
     originated in the recent discoveries, promising to sell
     nothing but the Unadulterated Tea, and it is sincerely to be
     hoped has done some good.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>sentence as he spoke it: "horse-beans have been converted to
coffee, and sloe-leaves have been transformed into tea; hog's lard has
been manufactured for butter; an ingenious gentleman wishes to persuade
us <i>Periwinkles</i>{1} are young Lobsters; and another has proposed to
extract sugar, and some say brandy, out of pea-shells! London is the
mart for inventions and discoveries of all kinds, and every one of its
inhabitants appears to have studied something of the art of Legerdemain,
to catch the eye and deceive the senses."
</p>
<p>
"Wonderful!" exclaimed Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Not more wonderful than true," continued Sparkle; "invention is always
on the stretch in London. Here we have cast-iron Bridges{2}&mdash;a cast-iron
Sugar-house&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
     1 Sparkle appears to have been rather sceptical on the
     subject of Periwinkles being young Lobsters, though the
     opinion is not very new. A gentleman, whose indefatigable
     research appears to be deserving of encouragement and
     support, has recently issued the following advertisement,
     inviting the curious and the learned to inspect the result
     of his discoveries, which seems, at least, to warrant
     something more than conjecture.

     "J. Cleghorne having in his possession some specimens which
     prove, in his opinion, a circumstance before suggested, but
     treated by the scientific as a vulgar error, any known
     naturalist willing to view them, by noticing by letter,
     within a week, may have J. C. attend with his specimens. The
     subject is a curious change in the formation of Lobsters
     from various species of the Winkle, the Winkle being
     considered the larva;.

     The only advantage J. C. desires from the communication is,
     the credit of advancing his proofs, and the stimulating
     further enquiry.&mdash;A line addressed to J. Cleghorne,
     Architectural Engraver, No. 19, Chapman-street, Black-road,
     Islington, will have immediate attention."

     It is sincerely to be hoped that proper notice will be taken
     of this advertisement, for in times of general scarcity like
     the present, such a discovery might be turned to great
     national advantage, by the establishment of proper depots
     for the cultivation of lobsters, as we have preserves for
     game, &amp;c.

     2 Cast-iron has become an object of general utility. The
     Southwark or New London Bridge consists of three arches, the
     centre of which is a span of 240 feet, and the other two 210
     feet each; the Vauxhall Bridge consists of nine arches, over
     a width of 809 feet; and it is a fact, that a Sugar-house is
     building with cast-iron floors, window-frames, and rafters,
     to prevent fire. Cast-iron holds fire and resists fire; but
     it is probable that all its properties and powers are not
     yet discovered, and that we may some day or other witness
     the ascension of a cast-iron balloon inflated with steam!

burning itself, and money burning men's consciences."
</p>
<p>
"Well done, Sparkle!" cried Tom; "your ideas seem to flow like gas,
touch but the valve and off you go; and you are equally diffusive, for
you throw a light upon all subjects."
</p>
<p>
Bob was now suddenly attracted by a full view of himself and his friends
at the further end of Everington's{2}
</p>
<pre>
     1 Steam&mdash;Here is a subject that evaporates as we approach;
     it soars beyond finite comprehension, and appears to be
     inexhaustible&mdash;every thing is done by it&mdash;machinery of every
     kind is set in motion by it&mdash;a newspaper of the most
     extensive circulation in the kingdom is printed by it, and
     the paper supplied sheet by sheet to receive the impression.
     Tobacco is manufactured, and sausage-meat cut, by steam&mdash;
     nay, a celebrated Vender of the latter article had asserted,
     that his machinery was in such a state of progressive
     improvement, that he had little doubt before long of making
     it supply the demands of his customers, and thereby save the
     expense of a Shopman; but, it is much to be regretted, his
     apparatus made sausage-meat of him before the accomplishment
     of his project.

     Considering the increasing, and by some Philosophers almost
     overwhelming population of the country at the present
     moment, it is certainly an alarming circumstance, that when
     employment is so much required, mechanical science should so
     completely supersede it to the injury of thousands,
     independent of the many who have lost their lives by the
     blowing up of steam-engines. It is a malady however which
     must be left to our political economists, who will
     doubtless at the same time determine which would prove the
     most effectual remedy&mdash;the recommendation of Mr. Malthus to
     condemn the lower orders to celibacy&mdash;the Jack Tars to a
     good war&mdash;or the Ministers to emigration.

     2  If an estimate of the wealth or poverty of the nation
     were to lie formed from the appearance of the houses in the
     Metropolis, no one could be induced to believe that the
     latter had any existence among us. The splendour and taste
     of our streets is indescribable, and the vast improvements
     in the West are equally indicative of the former.

     The enormous increase of rents for Shops, particularly in
     the leading thoroughfares of London, may in a great measure
     be attributed to the Linen-drapers. The usual method
     practised by some of these gentry, is to take a shop in the
     first-rate situation, pull down the old front, and erect a
     new one, regardless of expense, a good outside being
     considered the first and indispensable requisite. This is
     often effected, either upon credit with a builder, or, if
     they have a capital of a few hundreds, it is all exhausted
     in external decorations. Goods are obtained upon credit, and
     customers procured by puffing advertisements, and exciting
     astonishment at the splendid appearance of the front. Thus
     the concern is generally carried on till the credit obtained
     has expired, and the wonder and novelty of the concern has
     evaporated; when the stock is <i>sold off at 30 per cent,
     under prime cost for the benefit of the creditors</i>! This is
     so common an occurrence, that it is scarcely possible to
     walk through London any day in the year, without being
     attracted by numerous Linen-drapers' shops, whose windows
     are decorated with bills, indicating that they are actually
     selling off under prime cost, as the premises must be
     cleared in a few days.

     The most elegant Shop of this description in the Metropolis
     is supposed to be one not a hundred miles from Ludgate-hill,
     the front and fitting up of which alone is said to have cost
     several thousand pounds. The interior is nearly all of
     looking-glass, with gilt mouldings; even the ceiling is
     looking-glass, from which is appended splendid cut-glass
     chandeliers, which when lighted give to the whole the
     brilliance of enchantment; however it is not very easy to
     form an idea of what is sold, for, with the exception of a
     shawl or two carelessly thrown into the window, there is
     nothing to be seen, (the stock being all concealed in
     drawers, cupboards, &amp;c. ) except the decorations and the
     Dandy Shopmen, who parade up and down in a state of ecstasy
     at the reflection of their own pretty persons from every
     part of the premises!

     This concealment of the stock has occasioned some laughable
     occurrences. It is said that a gentleman from the country
     accidentally passing, took it for a looking-glass
     manufactory, and went in to inquire the price of a glass.
     The Shopmen gathered round him with evident surprise,
     assured him of his mistake, and directed him to go to
     Blades,{1} lower down the Hill. The Countryman was not
     disconcerted, but, after surveying them somewhat minutely,
     informed them it was glass he wanted, not cutlery; but as
     for blades, he thought there were enow there for one street,
     at least.

     Another is said to have been so pleased with a row of
     grotesque Indian-China jars, which embellish one side of the
     entrance, and which he mistook for <i>pots de chambre</i>, that
     after returning home and consulting his rib, he sent an
     order per post for one of the most elegant pattern to be
     forwarded to him!

     There is a similar Shop to this, though on a smaller scale,
     to be seen in a great leading thoroughfare at the West end
     of the Town; the owner of which, from his swarthy complexion
     and extravagant mode of dress, has been denominated The
     Black Prince, a name by which he is well known in his own
     neighbourhood, and among the gentlemen of the cloth. This
     dandy gentleman, who affects the dress and air of a military
     officer, has the egregious vanity to boast that the numerous
     families of rank and fashion who frequent his shop, are
     principally attracted to view his elegant person, and seems
     to consider that upon this principally depends the success
     of his trade.

himself surrounded with spectators, unconscious of being in their
company. He look'd up&mdash;he look'd down&mdash;he gazed around him, and all was
inconceivable light. Tom's allusion to the gas flashed upon him in a
moment&mdash;"What&mdash;what is this?" said he&mdash;"where, in the name of wonder, am
I?" A flash of lightning could not have operated more suddenly upon him.
"Why," said Sparkle, "don't you see?

"You are not here, for you are there,"
</p>
<p>
pointing to his reflection, in the looking-glass.

"Egad," said Bob, under evident surprise, and perhaps not without
some apprehension they were playing tricks with him&mdash;"I wish you would
explain&mdash;is this a Drawing-room, or is it the <i>Phantasmagoria</i> we have
heard so much of in the country?"
</p>
<p>
"No, no, it is not the Phantasmagoria, but it forms a part of
metropolitan magic, which you shall be better acquainted with before we
part. That is no other than a Linen-draper's shop, '<i>papered</i>,' as
an Irishman one day remarked, 'vvid nothing at all at all but
looking-glass, my dear '&mdash;one of the most superb things of the kind that
perhaps ever was seen&mdash;But come, I perceive it is getting late, let us
proceed directly to Dolly's, take our chop, then a <i>rattler</i>,{1} and hey

cheerful repast and an exhilarating glass of wine, a coach conveyed them

"Yes, yes," continued Sparkle, "every day produces novelty; for although
London itself is always the same, the inhabitants assume various forms,

By this time they had alighted, and were entering the House. The rapid
succession of carriages arriving with the company, the splendour of the
equipages, the general elegance of the dresses, and the blazing of the
lamps, alternately became objects of attraction to Bob, whose eyes were
kept in constant motion&mdash;while "A Bill of the Play for Covent Garden or
Drury Lane," still resounded in their ears.

<p>
On arriving at the Box-lobby, Tom, who was well known, was immediately
shewn into the centre box with great politeness by the Box-keeper,{1}
the second scene of the Tragedy being just over. The appearance of the
House was a delicious treat to Bob, whose visual orbs wandered more
among the delighted and delightful faces which surrounded him, than to
the plot or the progress of the performances before him. It was a scene
of splendour of which lie had not the least conception; and Sparkle
perceiving the principal objects of attraction, could not resist the
impulse to deliver, in a sort of half-whisper, the following lines:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "When Woman's soft smile all our senses bewilders,
          And gilds while it carves her dear form on the heart,
          What need has new Drury of carvers and gilders?
          With nature so bounteous, why call upon art?

     1 The Box-keeper to a public Theatre has many duties to
     perform to the public, his employer, and himself; but,
     perhaps, in order to be strictly correct, we ought to have
     reversed the order in which we have noticed them, since of
     the three, the latter appears to be the most important, (at
     least) in his consideration; for he takes care before the
     commencement of the performance to place one of his
     automaton figures on the second row of every box, which
     commands a good view of the House, who are merely intended
     to sit with their hats off, and to signify that the two
     first seats are taken, till the conclusion of the second
     act; and so in point of fact they are taken by himself, for
     the accommodation of such friends as he is quite aware are
     willing to accommodate him with <i>a quid pro quo</i>.

          How well would our Actors attend to their duties,
          Our House save in oil, and our Authors in wit,

          In lieu of yon lamps, if a row of young Beauties
          Glanc'd light from their eyes between us and the Pit.

          The apples that grew on the fruit-tree of knowledge
          By Woman were pluck'd, and she still wears the prize,

          To tempt us in Theatre, Senate, or College&mdash;
          I mean the Love-apples that bloom in the eyes.

          There too is the lash which, all statutes controlling,
          Still governs the slaves that are made by the Fair,

          For Man is the pupil who, while her eye's rolling,
          Is lifted to rapture, or sunk in despair."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>Tallyho eagerly listened to his friend's recitation of lines so
consonant with his own enraptured feelings; while his Cousin Dashall was
holding a conversation in dumb-show with some person at a distance,
who was presently recognized by Sparkle to be Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;den,{1} a
well-known frequenter of the House.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said he, "I see how it is with Tom&mdash;you may rely upon it he
will not stop long where he is, there is other game in view&mdash;he has but
little taste for Tragedy fiction, the Realities of Life are the objects
of his regard.
</p>
<p>
"Tis a fine Tragedy," continued he, addressing himself to Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes," replied the other, "I dare say it is, but, upon my soul,
I know nothing about it&mdash;that is&mdash;I have seen it before, and I mean to
read it."
</p>
<p>
"Bless my heart!" said a fat lady in a back seat, "what a noise them
'are gentlemen does make&mdash;they talk so loud there 'ant no such thing
as seeing what is said&mdash;I wonder they don't make these here boxes more
bigger, for I declare I'm so scrouged I'm all in a&mdash;Fanny, did you bring
the rumperella for fear it should rain as we goes home?"
</p>
<p>
"Hush, Mother," said a plump-faced little girl, who sat along side of
her&mdash;"don't talk so loud, or otherwise every body will hear you instead
of the Performers, and that would be quite preposterous."
</p>
<p>
"Don't call me <i>posterous</i> Miss; because you have been to school, and
learnt some <i>edification</i>, you thinks you are to do as you please with
me."
</p>
<pre>
     1 Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;den, a dashing Cyprian of the first order, well
     known in the House, a fine, well-made woman, always ready
     for a lark, and generally well togged.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>This interesting conversation was interrupted by loud
vociferations of Bravo, Bravo, from all parts of the House, as the
drop-scene fell upon the conclusion of the second act. The clapping of
hands, the whistling and noise that ensued for a few minutes, appeared
to astonish Tallyho. "I don't much like my seat," said Dashall. "No,"
said Sparkle, "I did not much expect you would remain long&mdash;you are a
mighty ambitious sort of fellow, and I perceive you have a desire to be
exalted."
</p>
<p>
"I confess the situation, is too confined," replied Tom&mdash;"come, it is
excessively warm here, let us take a turn and catch a little air."
</p>
<p>
The House was crowded in every part; for the announcement of a new
Tragedy from the pen of Lord Byron, particularly under the circumstances
of its introduction to the Stage, against the expressed inclination of
its Author, the
</p>
<pre>
     1 At an early hour on the evening this Tragedy was first
     pro-duced at Drury Lane, Hand-bills were plentifully
     distributed through the Theatre, of which the following is a
     copy:

     "The public are respectfully informed, that the
     representation of Lord Byron's Tragedy, The Doge of Venice,
     this evening, takes place in defiance of the injunction from
     the Lord Chancellor, which was not applied for until the
     remonstrance of the Publisher, at the earnest desire of the
     noble Author, had failed in protecting that Drama from its
     intrusion on the Stage, for which it was never intended."

     This announcement had the effect of exciting public
     expectation beyond its usual pitch upon such occasions. The
     circumstances were somewhat new in the history of the Drama:
     the question being, whether a published Flay could be
     legally brought on the Stage without the consent, or rather
     we should say, in defiance of the Author. "We are not aware
     whether this question has been absolutely decided, but this
     we do know, that the Piece was performed several nights, and
     underwent all the puffing of the adventurous Manager, as
     well as all the severity of the Critics. The newspapers of
     the day were filled with histories and observations upon it.
     No subject engrossed the conversation of the polite and
     play-going part of the community but Lord Byron, The Doge of
     Venice, and Mr. Elliston. They were all bepraised and
     beplastered&mdash;exalted and debased&mdash;acquitted and condemned;
     but it was generally allowed on all hands, that the printed
     Tragedy contained many striking beauties, notwithstanding
     its alleged resemblance to Venice Preserved. We are,
     however, speaking of the acted Tragedy, and the magnanimous
     Manager, who with such promptitude produced it in an altered
     shape; and having already alluded to the theatrical puffing
     so constantly resorted to upon all occasions, we shall drop
     the curtain upon the subject, after merely remarking, that
     the Times of the same day has been known to contain the
     Manager's puff, declaring the piece to have been
     received with  rapturous applause,   in  direct  opposition
     to the  Editor's critique, which as unequivocally pronounced
     its complete failure!
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>will of its publisher, and the injunction{1} of the Lord
Chancellor, were attractions of no ordinary nature; and
</p>
<pre>
     1 Injunction&mdash;The word injunction implies a great deal, and
     has in its sound so much of the terrific, as in many
     instances to paralyze exertion on the part of the supposed
     offending person or persons. It has been made the instrument
     of artful, designing, and malicious persons, aided by
     pettifogging or pretended attorneys, to obtain money for
     themselves and clients by way of compromise; and in numerous
     instances it is well known that fear has been construed into
     actual guilt. Injunctions are become so common, that even
     penny printsellers have lately issued threats, and promised
     actual proceedings, against the venders of articles said to
     be copies from their original drawings, and even carried it
     so far as to withhold (kind souls!) the execution of their
     promises, upon the payment of a 5L. from those who were
     easily to be duped, having no inclination to encounter the
     glorious uncertainty of the law, or no time to spare for
     litigation. We have recently been furnished with a curious
     case which occurred in Utopia, where it appears by our
     informant, that the laws hold great similarity with our own.
     A certain house of considerable respectability had imported
     a large quantity of Welsh cheese, which were packed in
     wooden boxes, and offered them for sale (a great rarity in
     Eutopia) as double Gloucester.

     It is said that two of a trade seldom agree; how far the
     adage may apply to Eutopia, will be seen in the sequel. A
     tradesman, residing in the next street, a short time after,
     received an importation from Gloucester, of the favourite
     double production of that place, packed in a similar way,
     and (as was very natural for a tradesman to do, at least we
     know it is so here,) the latter immediately began to vend
     his cheese as the real Double Gloucester. This was an
     offence beyond bearing. The High Court of Equity was moved,
     similar we suppose to our High Court of Chancery, to
     suppress the sale of the latter; but as no proof of
     deception could be produced, it was not granted. This only
     increased the flame already excited in the breasts of the
     first importers; every effort was made use of to find a good
     and sufficient excuse to petition the Court again, and at
     length they found out one of the craft to swear, that as the
     real Gloucester had been imported in boxes of a similar
     shape, make, and wood, it was quite evident that the
     possessor must have bought similar cheeses, and was imposing
     on the public to their great disadvantage, notwithstanding
     they could not find a similarity either of taste, smell, or
     appearance. In the mean time the real Gloucester cheese
     became a general favourite with the inhabit-ants of Utopia,
     and upon this, though slender ground, the innocent tradesman
     was served with a process, enjoining him not to do that,
     which, poor man, he never intended to do; and besides if he
     had, the people of that country were not such ignoramuses as
     to be so deceived; it was merely to restrain him from
     selling his own real double Gloucester as their Welsh
     cheeses, purporting, as they did, to be double Gloucester,
     or of mixing them together (than which nothing could be
     further from his thoughts,) and charging him at the same
     time with having sold his cheeses under their name. But the
     most curious part of the business was, the real cheeseman
     brought the investigation before the Court, cheeses in boxes
     were produced, and evidence was brought forward, when, as
     the charges alleged could not be substantiated, the
     restraint was removed, and the three importers of Welsh
     cheese hung their heads, and retired in dudgeon.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>the Hon. Tom availed himself of the circumstance to leave the Box,
though the truth was, there were other attractions of a more enlivening
cast in his view.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said he, "we shall have a better opportunity of seeing the
House, and its decorations, by getting nearer to the curtain; besides,
Ave shall have a bird's-eye view of the company in all quarters, from
the seat of the Gods to the Pit."
</p>
<p>
The influx of company, (it being the time of half-price), and the
rush and confusion which took place in all parts at this moment, were
indescribable. Jumping over boxes and obtaining seats by any means,
regardless of politeness or even of decorum&mdash;Bucks and Bloods warm
from the pleasures of the bottle&mdash;dashing Belles and flaming Beaux,
squabbling and almost fighting&mdash;rendered the amusements before the
curtain of a momentary interest, which appeared to obliterate the
recollection of what they had previously witnessed. In the mean time,
the Gods in the Gallery issued forth an abundant variety of discordant
sounds, from their elevated situation. Growling of bears, grunting of
hogs, braying of donkeys, gobbling of turkeys, hissing of geese,
the catcall, and the loud shrill whistle, were heard in one mingling
concatenation of excellent imitation and undistinguished variety: During
which, Tom led the way to the upper Boxes, where upon arriving, he
was evidently disappointed at not meeting the party who had been
seen occupying a seat on the left side of the House, besides having
sacrificed a front seat, to be now compelled to take one at the very
back part of a side Box, an exchange by no means advantageous for a view
of the performance. However, this was compensated in some degree by a
more extensive prospect round the House; and his eyes were seen moving
in all directions, without seeming to know where to fix, while Sparkle
and Bob were attracted by a fight in the Gallery, between a Soldier and
a Gentleman's Servant in livery, for some supposed <span class="pagenum">[135]</span>insult offered
to the companion of the latter, and which promised serious results
from the repeated vociferations of those around them, of "Throw 'em
over&mdash;throw 'em over;" while the gifts of the Gods were plentifully
showered down upon the inhabitants of the lower regions in the shape
of orange-peelings, apples, &amp;c. The drawing up of the curtain however
seemed to have some little effect upon the audience, and in a moment the
Babel of tongues was changed into a pretty general cry of "Down&mdash;down
in the front&mdash;hats off&mdash;silence, &amp;c. which at length subsided in every
quarter but the Gallery, where still some mutterings and murmurings were
at intervals to be heard.
</p>
<pre>
          "&mdash;&mdash;one fiddle will
          Produce a tiny flourish still."
</pre>
<p>
Sparkle could neither see nor hear the performance&mdash;Tom was wholly
engaged in observing the company, and Bob alternately straining his neck
to get a view of the Stage, and then towards the noisy inhabitants of
the upper regions. "We dined at the Hummums," said a finicking little
Gentleman just below him&mdash;"Bill, and I, and Harry&mdash;drank claret like
fishes&mdash;Harry was half-sprung&mdash;fell out with a Parson about chopping
logic; you know Harry's father was a butcher, and used to chopping,
so it was all prime&mdash;the Parson would'n't be convinced, though Harry
knock'd down his argument with his knuckles on the table, almost hard
enough to split it&mdash;it was a bang-up lark&mdash;Harry got in a passion,
doff'd his toggery, and was going to show fight&mdash;so then the Parson
sneak'd off&mdash;Such a bit of gig.'"
</p>
<p>
"Silence there, behind."
</p>
<p>
"So then," continued the Dandy, "we went to the Billiard-rooms, in Fleet
Street, played three games, diddled the Flats, bilk'd the Marker, and
bolted&mdash;I say, when did you see Dolly?"{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 To the frequenters of Drury-lane Theatre, who occasionally
     lounge away a little of their time between the acts in
     sipping soda-water, negus, &amp;c. the party here alluded to
     cannot but be well known&mdash;we mean particularly the laffing-
     boys and the lads of the village. We are aware that
     fictitious names are assumed or given to the Ladies of
     Saloon notoriety, originating in particular circum-stances,
     and we have reason to believe that Dolly K&mdash;&mdash;lly has been
     so denominated from the propensity she almost invariably
     manifests of painting, as remarked particularly by one of
     the parties in conversation.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>"Last night," replied the other&mdash;"she'll be here
presently&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;nd fine girl, arn't she?"
</p>
<p>
"Very well," said the first; "a nice plump face, but then she paints
so d&mdash;n&mdash;bly, I hate your painted Dollys, give me natural flesh and
blood&mdash;Polly H&mdash;ward for me."
</p>
<p>
"Gallows Tom{1} will speak to you in plain terms if you trespass there,
my boy; you know he has out-general'd the Captain in that quarter, and
came off victorious, so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Come," said Sparkle, "let us adjourn into the Saloon, for, Heaven
knows, it is useless staying here." And taking their arms, they
immediately left the Box.
</p>
<p>
"The theatre," continued he, "is a sort of enchanted island, where
nothing appears as it really is, nor what it should be. In London, it is
a sort of time-killer, or exchange of looks and smiles. It is frequented
by persons of all degrees and qualities whatsoever. Here Lords come
to laugh and be laughed at&mdash;Knights to learn the amorous smirk and
a-la-mode grin, the newest fashion in the cut of his garments, the twist
of his body, and the adjustment of his phiz.
</p>
<p>
"This House{2} was built upon a grand and extensive scale, designed and
executed under the inspection of Mr. Benj. Wyatt, the architect, whose
skill was powerfully and liberally aided by an intelligent and public
spirited Committee, of which the late Mr. Whitbread was the Chairman. It
is altogether a master-piece of art, and an ornament to the Metropolis.
You perceive the interior is truly delightful, and the exterior presents
the idea of solidity and security: it affords sitting room for 2810
persons, that is, 1200 in the Boxes, 850 in the Pit, 480
</p>
<pre>
     1 It appears that the adoption of fictitious names is not
     wholly confined to the female visitors of these regions of
     fashion and folly. Gallows Tom is a character well known,
     and is a sort of general friend, at all times full of fun,
     fire, and spirit. We have not been able to discover whether
     he holds any official situation under government, though it
     is generally believed he is safely anchored under the croum,
     a stanch friend to the British constitution&mdash;probably more
     so than to his own. And we should judge from what is to be
     inferred from the conversation overheard, that he is the
     acknowledged friend of Miss H&mdash;&mdash;d.   Capt. T&mdash;&mdash;pe is
     supposed to hold a Commission in the Navy, a gay and gallant
     frequenter of the Saloon, and, till a short time back, the
     chere ami of Miss H&mdash;&mdash;d.

     2 The building of this Theatre was completed for 112,000L.
     Including lamps, furniture, &amp;c. 125,000L.; and including
     scent ry, wardrobe, properties, &amp;c. 150,000L.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>in the Lower Gallery, and 280 in the Upper Gallery. The talents of
the celebrated Mr. Kean (who has recently left us for the shores of the
Atlantic) first blazed forth to astonish the world beneath this roof.
Old Drury immortalized the name of Garrick, and has also established the
fame of Mr. Kean; and the House at the present moment has to boast of a
combination of histrionic{1} talent, rich and excellent."
</p>
<p>
"Come along, come along," said Tom, interrupting him, "leave these
explanations for another opportunity&mdash;here is the Saloon. Now for a peep
at old particulars. There is no seeing nor hearing the Play&mdash;I have no
inclination for histories, I am just alive for a bit of gig."
</p>
<p>
On entering the Saloon, Bob was additionally gratified at viewing
the splendour of its decorations. The arched ceiling, the two massy
Corinthian columns of <i>vera antique</i>, and the ten corresponding
pilasters on each side, struck him as particularly beautiful, and he was
for some moments lost in contemplation, while his friends Sparkle and
Tom were in immediate request to receive the congratulations of their
acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
"Where the d&mdash;&mdash;l have you been to?" was the first question addressed
to Dashall&mdash;"rusticating, I suppose, to the serious loss of all polished
society."
</p>
<p>
"You are right in the first part of your reply," said Tom; "but, as I
conceive, not exactly so in the inference you draw from it."
</p>
<p>
"Modesty, by Jove! well done Dashall, this travelling appears to improve
your manners wonderfully; and I dare say if you had staid away another
month, your old friends would not have known you."
</p>
<p>
This created a laugh among the party, which roused Bob from his reverie,
who, turning round rather hastily, trod with considerable force upon
the gouty toe of an old debauchee in spectacles, who, in the height
of ecstasy, was at that moment entering into a treaty of amity with a
pretty rosy-faced little girl, and chucking her under the

     Munden, Holland, Wallack, Knight, T. Cooke, Oxberry, Smith,
     Bromley, &amp;c. are to be found on the male list of Performers,
     and it is sincerely to be hoped that of Mr. Kean will not
     long be absent. The females are, Mrs. Davison, Mrs. Glover,
     Miss Kelly, Mrs. Bland, Mrs. Orger, Mrs. Sparks, Miss
     Wilson, Miss Byrne, Miss Cubitt, &amp;c.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>chin, as a sort of preliminary, to be succeeded by a ratification;
for in all probability gratification was out of the question. However
this might be, the pain occasioned by the sudden movement of Tallyho,
who had not yet learned to trip it lightly along the <i>mutton walk</i>,{1}
induced the sufferer to roar out most lustily, a circumstance which
immediately attracted the attention of every one in the room, and in a
moment they were surrounded by a group of lads and lasses.

<p>
"Upon my soul, Sir," stammer'd out Bob, "I beg your pardon, I&mdash;I&mdash;did
not mean&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! oh! oh!" continued the gouty Amoroso. Mother K&mdash;&mdash;p{2} came
running like lightning with a glass of water; the frail sisterhood
were laughing, nodding, whispering, and winking at each other; while
St&mdash;&mdash;ns,{3} who pick'd up the spectacles the unfortunate victim of
the gout had dropp'd, swore that fellow in the green coat and white
hat ought to be sent to some dancing-school, to learn to step without
kicking people's shins.
</p>
<p>
Another declared he was a Johnny-raw,{4} just catched, and what could be
expected.
</p>
<p>
Tom, who, however, kept himself alive to the passing occurrences,
stepping up to Bob, was immediately recognized by all around him, and
passing a significant wink, declared it was an accident, and begged to
assist the Old Buck to a seat, which being accomplished, he declared
he had not had his shoe on for a week, but as he found himself able to
walk, he could not resist the temptation of taking a look around him.
</p>
<p>
Over a bottle of wine the unpleasant impressions made by this
unfortunate occurrence appeared to be removed. In the mean time, Tom
received a hundred congratulations and salutations; while Sparkle, after
a glass or two, was missing.
</p>
<p>
Dashall informed the friends around him, that his Cousin was a pupil of
his, and begged to introduce him
</p>
<pre>
     1 Mutton Walk&mdash;A flash term recently adopted to denominate
     the Saloon.

     2 A well known fruit-woman, who is in constant attendance,
     well acquainted with the girls and their protectors, and
     ready upon all occasions to give or convey information for
     the benefit of both parties.

     3 St&mdash;&mdash;ns&mdash;A very pretty round-faced young lady-bird, of
     rather small figure, inclining to be lusty.

     4 Johnny Raw&mdash;A country bumpkin.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>as a future visitor to this gay scene. This had an instantaneous
effect upon the trading fair ones, who began immediately to throw out
their lures. One declared he had a sweet pretty brooch; another, that
she knew he was a trump by the cut of his jib; a third, that he look'd
like a gentleman, for she liked the make of his mug; a fourth, that his
hat was a very pretty shaped one, although it was of a radical colour;
and while Tom and the ladybird{l} were soothing the pains of the
grey-headed wanton, Bob was as busily employed in handing about the
contents of the bottle. A second and a third succeeded, and it was not
a little astonishing to him that every bottle improved his appearance;
for, though not one of his admirers remained long with him, yet the
absence of one only brought another, equally attracted by his look and
manner: every one declared he was really a gentleman in every respect,
and in the course of their short parley, did not fail to slip a card
into his hand. By this time he began to grow chatty, and was enabled
to rally in turn the observations they made. He swore he lov'd them all
round, and once or twice hummed over,
</p>
<pre>
          "Dear creatures, we can't do without them,
          They're all that is sweet and seducing to man,
          Looking, sighing about, and about them,
          We doat on them&mdash;do for them, all that we can."
</pre>
<p>
The play being over, brought a considerable influx of company into
the Saloon. The regular covies paired off with their covesses, and the
moving panorama of elegance and fashion presented a scene that was truly
delightful to Bob.
</p>
<p>
The Ladybird, who had been so attentive to the gouty customer, now
wished him a good night, for, said she, "There is my friend,{2} and so I
am off." This seemed only to increase the agony of his already agonized
toe, notwithstanding which he presently toddled off, and was seen no
more for the evening.
</p>
<p>
"What's become of Sparkle," enquired Tom. "Stole away," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
"Tipp'd us the double, has he," said Dashall. "Well, what think you of
Drury-lane?"
</p>
<pre>
     1 Lady-bird&mdash;A dashing Cyprian.

     2 The term friend is in constant use among accessible
     ladies, and signifies their protector or keeper.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>"'Tis a very delightful tragedy indeed, but performed in the most
comical manner I ever witnessed in my life."
</p>
<p>
"Pshaw!" said Bob, "very few indeed, except the critics and the plebs,
come here to look at the play; they come to see and be seen."
</p>
<p>
"Egad then," said Bob, "a great many have been gratified to-night, and
perhaps I have been highly honoured, for every person that has passed me
has complimented me with a stare."
</p>
<p>
"Which of course you did not fail to return?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly not; and upon my soul you have a choice show of fruit here."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," continued Tom, "London is a sort of hot-house, where fruit is
forced into ripeness by the fostering and liberal sun of Folly, sooner
than it would be, if left to its natural growth. Here however, you
observe nothing but joyful and animated features, while perhaps the
vulture of misery is gnawing at the heart. I could give you histories of
several of these unfortunates,{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 A life of prostitution is a life fraught with too many
     miseries to be collected in any moderate compass. The mode
     in which they are treated, by parties who live upon the
     produce of their infamy, the rude and boisterous, nay, often
     brutal manner in which they are used by those with whom they
     occasionally associate, and the horrible reflections of
     their own minds, are too frequently and too fatally
     attempted to be obliterated by recourse to the Bacchanalian
     fount. Reason becomes obscured, and all decency and
     propriety abandoned. Passion rules predominantly until it
     extinguishes itself, and leaves the wretched victim of early
     delusion, vitiated both in body and mind, to drag on a
     miserable existence, without character, without friends, and
     almost without hope. There is unfortunately, however, no
     occasion for the exercise of imagination on this subject.
     The annals of our police occurrences, furnish too many
     examples of actual circumstances, deeply to be deplored; and
     we have selected one of a most atrocious kind which recently
     took place, and is recorded as follows:&mdash;

                    <i>Prostitution</i>.

     "An unfortunate girl, apparently about eighteen years of
     age, and of the most interesting and handsome person, but
     whose attire indicated extreme poverty and distress, applied
     to the sitting magistrate, Richard Bimie, Esq. under the
     following circum-stances:&mdash;It appeared from the statement,
     that she had for the last three weeks been living at a house
     of ill fame in Exeter-street, Strand, kept by a man named
     James Locke: this wretch had exacted the enormous sum of
     three guineas per week for her board and lodging, and in
     consequence of her not being able to pay the sum due for the
     last week, he threatened to strip her of her cloaths, and
     turn her naked into the street. This threat he deferred
     executing until yesterday morning (having in the mean time
     kept her locked up in a dark room, without any covering
     whatever,) when in lieu of her cloaths, he gave her the
     tattered and loathsome garments she then appeared in, which
     were barely sufficient to preserve common decency, and then
     brutally turned her into the street. Being thus plunged into
     the most abject wretchedness, without money or friends, to
     whom she could apply in her present situation, her bodily
     strength exhausted by the dissipated life she had led, and
     rendered more so by a long abstinence from food; her spirits
     broken and overcome by the bitter and humiliating
     reflection, that her own guilty conduct debarred her from
     flying to the fostering arms of affectionate parents, whom
     she had loaded with disgrace and misery; and the now
     inevitable exposure of her infamy, it was some time ere her
     wandering senses were sufficiently composed to determine
     what course she should pursue in the present emergency, when
     she thought she could not do better than have recourse to
     the justice of her country against the villain Lock, who had
     so basely treated her; and after extreme pain and
     difficulty, she succeeded in dragging her enfeebled limbs to
     the Office. During the detail of the foregoing particulars,
     she seemed overwhelmed with shame and remorse, and at times
     sobbed so violently as to render her voice inarticulate. Her
     piteous case excited the attention and sympathy of all
     present; and it was much to the general satisfaction that
     Mr. Bimie ordered Humphries, one of the conductors of the
     Patrol, to fetch Lock to the Office. On being brought there,
     the necessary proceedings were gone into for the purpose of
     indicting the house as a common brothel.

     "It was afterwards discovered that this unhappy girl was of
     the most respectable parents, and for the last six years had
     been residing with her Aunt. About three months ago, some
     difference having arisen between them, she absconded, taking
     with her only a few shillings, and the clothes she then
     wore. The first night of her remaining from home she went to
     Drury-lane Theatre, and was there pick'd up by a genteel
     woman dressed in black, who having learned her situation,
     enticed her to a house in Hart-street, Covent-garden, where
     the ruin of the poor girl was finally effected. It was not
     until she had immersed herself in vice and folly that she
     reflected on her situation, and it was then too late to
     retract; and after suffering unheard of miseries, was, in
     the short space of three months, reduced to her present
     state of wretchedness.

     "The worthy Magistrate ordered that proper care should be
     taken of the girl, which was readily undertaken on the part
     of the parish.

     "The Prisoner set up a defence, in which he said, a friend
     of the girl's owed him 14L. and that he detained her clothes
     for it&mdash;but was stopped by Mr. Bimie.

     "He at first treated the matter very lightly; but on
     perceiving the determination on the part of the parish to
     proceed, he offered to give up the things. This however he
     was not allowed to do."
</pre>
<p>
(who are exercising all their arts to entrap customers) apparently full
of life and vivacity, who perhaps dare not approach <span class="pagenum">[142]</span>their homes
without the produce of their successful blandishments. But this is not a
place for moralizing&mdash;a truce to Old Care and the Blue Devils&mdash;Come on,
my boy, let us take a turn in the Lobby&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Banish sorrow, griefs a folly;
          Saturn, bend thy wrinkled brow;
          Get thee hence, dull Melancholy,
          Mirth and wine invite us now.

          Love displays his mine of treasure,
          Comus brings us mirth and song!;
          Follow, follow, follow pleasure,
          Let us join the jovial throng."
</pre>
<p>
Upon this they adjourned to the Lobby, where a repetition of similar
circumstances took place, with only this difference, that Tally ho
having already been seen in the Saloon, and now introduced, leaning upon
the arm of his Cousin, the enticing goddesses of pleasure hung
around them at every step, every one anxious to be foremost in their
assiduities to catch the new-comer's smile; and the odds were almost a
cornucopia to a cabbage-net that Bob would be hook'd.
</p>
<p>
Tom was still evidently disappointed, and after pacing the Lobby once or
twice, and whispering Bob to make his observations the subject of future
inquiry, they returned to the Saloon, where Sparkle met them almost out
of breath, declaring he had been hunting them in all parts of the House
for the last half hour.
</p>
<p>
Tom laugh'd heartily at this, and complimented Sparkle on the ingenuity
with which he managed his affairs. "But I see how it is," said he, "and
I naturally suppose you are engaged."
</p>
<p>
"'Suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind,' and I perceive clearly that
you are only disappointed that you are not engaged&mdash;where are all your
<i>golden</i>{1} dreams now?"
</p>
<p>
"Pshaw! there is no such thing as speaking to you," said Tom, rather
peevishly, "without feeling a lash like a cart-whip."
</p>
<pre>
     1 This was a touch of the satirical which it appears did not
     exactly suit the taste of Dashall, as it applied to the
     Ladybird who had attracted his attention on entering the
     house.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>"Merely in return," continued Sparkle, "for the genteel, not to
say gentle manner, in which you handle the horse-whip."
</p>
<p>
"There is something very mulish in all this," said Bob, interrupting the
conversation, "I don't understand it."
</p>
<p>
"Nor I neither," said Tom, leaving the arm of his Cousin, and stepping
forward.
</p>
<p>
This hasty dismissal of the subject under debate had been occasioned by
the appearance of a Lady, whose arm Tom immediately took upon leaving
that of his cousin, a circumstance which seemed to restore harmony to
all parties. Tallyho and Sparkle soon joined them, and after a few turns
for the purpose of seeing, and being seen, it was proposed to adjourn
to the Oyster-shop directly opposite the front of the Theatre; and with
that view they in a short time departed, but not without an addition of
two other ladies, selected from the numerous frequenters of the Saloon,
most of whom appeared to be well known both to Tom and Sparkle.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of the outside was very pleasing&mdash;the brilliance of the
lights&mdash;the neat and cleanly style in which its contents were displayed
seemed inviting to appetite, and in a very short time a cheerful repast
was served up; while the room was progressively filling with company,
and Mother P&mdash;&mdash;was kept in constant activity.
</p>
<p>
Bob was highly gratified with the company, and the manner in which they
were entertained.
</p>
<p>
A vast crowd of dashing young Beaux and elegantly dressed Belles,
calling about them for oysters, lobsters, salmon, shrimps, bread
and butter, soda-water, ginger-beer, &amp;c. kept up a sort of running
accompaniment to the general conversation in which they were engaged;
when the mirth and hilarity of the room was for a moment delayed upon
the appearance of a dashing Blade, who seemed as he entered to say to
himself,
</p>
<p>
"Plebeians, avaunt! I have altered my plan, Metamorphosed completely,
behold a Fine Man! That is, throughout town I am grown quite the rage,
The meteor of fashion, the Buck of the age."
</p>
<p>
He was dressed in the extreme of fashion, and seemed desirous of
imparting the idea of his great importance to all around him: he had
a light-coloured great-coat with immense mother o' pearl buttons
and double <span class="pagenum">[144]</span>capes, Buff or Petersham breeches, and coat of
<i>sky-blue</i>,{1} his hat cocked on one side, and stout ground-ashen stick
in his hand. It was plain to be seen that the juice of the grape had
been operative upon the upper story, as he reeled to the further end of
the room, and, calling the attendant, desired her to bring him a bottle
of soda-water, for he was <i>lushy</i>,{2} by G&mdash;&mdash;d; then throwing himself
into a box, which he alone occupied, he stretched himself at length on
the seat, and seemed as if he would go to sleep.
</p>
<p>
"That (said Sparkle) is a distinguished Member of the Tilbury Club, and
is denominated a Ruffian, a kind of character that gains ground, as to
numbers, over the Exquisite, but he is very different in polish.
</p>
<pre>
     1  A partiality to these coloured habits is undoubtedly
     intended to impress upon the minds of plebeian beholders an
     exalted idea of their own consequence, or to prove, perhaps,
     that their conceptions are as superior to common ones as the
     sky is to the earth.

     2  The variety of denominations that have at different times
     been given to drunkenness forms an admirable specimen of
     ingenuity well worthy of remark. The derivation of Lushy, we
     believe, is from a very common expression, that a drunken
     man votes for Lushington; but perhaps it would be rather
     difficult to discover the origin of many terms made use of
     to express a jolly good fellow, and no flincher under the
     effects of good fellowship. It is said&mdash;that he is drunk,
     intoxicated, fuddled, muddled, flustered, rocky, reely,
     tipsy, merry, half-boosy, top-heavy, chuck-full, cup-sprung,
     pot-valiant, maudlin, a little how came you so, groggy,
     jolly, rather mightitity, in drink, in his cups, high, in
     uubibus, under the table, slew'd, cut, merry, queer, quisby,
     sew'd up, over-taken, elevated, cast away, concerned, half-
     coek'd, exhilarated, on a merry pin, a little in the suds,
     in a quandary, wing'd as wise as Solomon.
</pre>
<p>
It is also said, that he has business on both sides of the way, got his
little hat on, bung'd his eye, been in the sun, got a spur in his head,
(this is frequently used by brother Jockeys to each other) got a crumb
in his beard, had a little, had enough, got more than he can carry, been
among the Philistines, lost his legs, been in a storm, got his night-cap
on, got his skin full, had a cup too much, had his cold tea, a red eye,
got his dose, a pinch of snuff in his wig, overdone it, taken draps,
taking a lunar, sugar in his eye, had his wig oil'd, that he is diddled,
dish'd and done up.
</p>
<p>
He clips the King's English, sees double, reels, heels a little, heels
and sets, shews his hob-nails, looks as if he couldn't help it, takes an
observation, chases geese, loves a drap, and cannot sport a right line,
can't walk a chalk.
</p>
<p>
He is as drunk as a piper, drunk as an owl, drunk as David's sow, drunk
as a lord, fuddled as an ape, merry as a grig, happy as a king.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>"In the higher circles, a Ruffian is one of the many
mushroom-productions which the sun of prosperity brings to life. Stout
in general is his appearance, but Dame Nature has done little for him,
and Fortune has spoilt even that little. To resemble his groom and his
coachman is his highest ambition. He is a perfect horseman, a perfect
whip, but takes care never to be a perfect gentleman. His principal
accomplishments are sporting, swaggering, milling, drawing, and
greeking.{1} He takes the ribands in his hands, mounts his box, with
Missus by his side&mdash;"All right, ya hip, my hearties"&mdash;drives his empty
mail with four prime tits&mdash;cuts out a Johnny-raw&mdash;shakes his head, and
lolls out his tongue at him; and if he don't break his own neck, gets
safe home after his morning's drive.
</p>
<p>
"He is always accompanied by a brace at least of dogs in his morning
visits; and it is not easy to determine on these occasions which is the
most troublesome animal of the two, the biped or the quadruped."
</p>
<p>
This description caused a laugh among the Ladybirds, who thought it
vastly amusing, while it was also listened to with great attention by
Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
The Hon. Tom Dashall in the mean time was in close conversation with his
mott{2} in the corner of the Box, and was getting, as Sparkle observed,
"rather nutty{3} in that quarter of the globe."
</p>
<p>
The laugh which concluded Sparkle's account of the Tilbury-club man
roused him from his sleep, and also attracted the attention of Tom and
his inamorata.
</p>
<p>
"D&mdash;&mdash;n my eyes," said the fancy cove, as he rubbed open his
peepers,{4}" am I awake or asleep?&mdash;what a h&mdash;&mdash;ll of a light there
is!"
</p>
<pre>
     1 Greeking&mdash;An epithet generally applied to gambling and
     gamblers, among the polished hells of society, principally
     to be found in and near St. James's: but of this more
     hereafter.

     2 Mott&mdash;A blowen, or woman of the town. We know not from
     whom or whence the word originated, but we recollect some
     lines of an old song in which the term is made use of, viz.

          "When first I saw this flaming Mutt,
          'Twas at the sign of the Pewter Pot;
          We call'd for some Purl, and we had it hot,
          With Gin and Bitters too."

     3 Nutty&mdash;Amorous.

     4 An elegant and expressive term for the eyes.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>This was followed immediately by the rattling of an engine with
two torches, accompanied by an immense concourse of people following it
at full speed past the window.
</p>
<p>
"It is well lit, by Jove," said the sleeper awake, "where ever it is;"
and with that he tipp'd the <i>slavey</i>{1}1 a tanner,{2} and mizzled.
</p>
<p>
The noise and confusion outside of the House completely put a stop to
all harmony and comfort within.
</p>
<p>
"It must be near us," said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"It is Covent Garden Theatre, in my opinion," said Sparkle.
</p>
<p>
Bob said nothing, but kept looking about him in a sort
</p>
<p>
of wild surprise.
</p>
<p>
"However," said Tom, "wherever it is, we must go and have a peep."
</p>
<p>
"You are a very gallant fellow, truly," said one of the bewitchers&mdash;"I
thought&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"And so did I," said Tom&mdash;"but 'rest the babe&mdash;the time it shall
come'&mdash;never mind, we won't be disappointed; but here, (said he) as I
belong to the Tip and Toddle Club, I don't mean to disgrace my calling,
by forgetting my duty." And slipping a something into her hand, her note
was immediately changed into,
</p>
<p>
"Well, I always thought you was a trump, and I likes a man that behaves
like a gentleman."
</p>
<p>
Something of the same kind was going on between the other two, which
proved completely satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
"So then, Mr. Author, it seems you have raised a fire to stew the
oysters, and leave your Readers to feast upon the blaze."
</p>
<p>
"Hold for a moment, and be not so testy, and for your satisfaction I can
solemnly promise, that if the oysters are stewed, you shall have good
and sufficient notice of the moment they are to be on table&mdash;But, bless
my heart, how the fire rages!&mdash;I can neither spare time nor wind to
parley a moment longer&mdash;Tom and Bob have already started off with the
velocity of a race-horse, and if I lose them, I should cut but a poor
figure with my Readers afterward.
</p>
<p>
"Pray, Sir, can you tell me where the fire is?" 'Really, Sir, I don't
know, but I am told it is somewhere by Whitechapel.'
</p>
<pre>
     1 Slaveys&mdash;Servants of either sex.

     2 Tanner&mdash;A flash term for a sixpence.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>"Could you inform me Madam, whereabouts the fire is?"
</p>
<p>
'Westminster Road, Sir, as I am informed.' "Westminster, and
Whitechapel&mdash;some little difference of opinion I find as usual&mdash;however,
I have just caught sight of Tom, and he's sure to be on the right scent;
so adieu, Mr. Reader, for the present, and have no doubt but I shall
soon be able to throw further light on the subject."

    CHAPTER XI
</h2>
<pre>
          "Some folks in the streets, by the Lord, made me stare,
          So comical, droll, is the dress that they wear,
          For the Gentlemen's waists are atop of their backs,
          And their large cassock trowsers they tit just like sacks.
          Then the Ladies&mdash;their dresses are equally queer,
          They wear such large bonnets, no face can appear:
          It puts me in mind, now don't think I'm a joker,
          Of a coal-scuttle stuck on the head of a poker.
          In their bonnets they wear of green leaves such a power,
          It puts me in mind of a great cauliflower;
          And their legs, 1 am sure, must be ready to freeze,
          For they wear all their petticoats up to their knees.
          They carry large bags full of trinkets and lockets,
          'Cause the fashion is now not to wear any pockets;
          "While to keep off the flies, and to hide from beholders,
          A large cabbage-net is thrown over their shoulders."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>IN a moment all was consternation, confusion, and alarm. The
brilliant light that illuminated the surrounding buildings presented
a scene of dazzling splendour, mingled with sensations of horror
not easily to be described. The rattling of engines, the flashing of
torches, and the shouting of thousands, by whom they were followed and
surrounded, all combined to give lively interest to the circumstance.
</p>
<p>
It was quickly ascertained that the dreadful conflagration had taken
place at an extensive Timber-yard, within a very short distance of
the Theatres, situated as it were nearly in the centre, between Covent
Garden and Drury Lane. Men, women, and children, were seen running in
all directions; and report, with his ten thousand tongues, here found an
opportunity for the exercise of them all; assertion and denial followed
each other in rapid succession, while the flames continued to increase.
Our party being thus abruptly disturbed in their anticipated enjoyments,
bade adieu to their Doxies,{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 Doxies&mdash;A flash term frequently made use of to denominate
     ladies of easy virtue.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>and rushed forward to the spot, where they witnessed the devouring
ravages of the yet unquenched element, consuming with resistless force
all that came in its way.
</p>
<p>
"Button up," said Tom, "and let us keep together, for upon these
occasions,
</p>
<p>
"The Scamps,{1} the Pads,{2} the Divers,{3} are all upon the lay."{4}
</p>
<p>
The Flash Molishers,{5} in the vicinity of Drury Lane, were out in
parties, and it was reasonable to suppose, that where there was so much
heat, considerable thirst must also prevail; consequently the Sluiceries
were all in high request, every one of those in the neighbourhood being
able to boast of overflowing Houses, without any imputation upon their
veracity. We say nothing of elegant genteel, or enlightened audiences,
so frequently introduced in the Bills from other houses in the
neighbourhood; even the door-ways were block'd up with the collectors
and imparters of information. Prognostications as to how and where it
began, how it would end, and the property that would be consumed, were
to be met at every corner&mdash;Snuffy Tabbies, and Boosy Kids, some giving
way to jocularity, and others indulging in lamentations.
</p>
<p>
"Hot, hot, hot, all hot," said a Black man, as he pushed in and out
among the crowd; with "Hoot awa', the de'il tak your soul, mon, don't
you think we are all hot eneugh?&mdash;gin ye bring more hot here I'll crack
your croon&mdash;I've been roasting alive for the last half hoor, an' want to
be ganging, but I can't get out."
</p>
<p>
"Hot, hot, hot, all hot, Ladies and Gentlemen," said the dingy dealer
in delicacies, and almost as soon disappeared among the crowd, where he
found better opportunities for vending his rarities.
</p>
<p>
"Lumps of pudding," said Tom, jerking Tallyho by the arm, "what do you
think of a slice? here's accommodation for you&mdash;all hot, ready dress'd,
and well done."
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" said Bob, "I think we shall be well done ourselves presently."
</p>
<p>
"Keep your hands out of my pockets, you lousy beggar,"

<pre>
     1 Scamps&mdash;Highwaymen.

     2 Pads&mdash;Foot-pads.

     3 Divers&mdash;Pickpockets.

     4  The Lay&mdash;Upon the look-out for opportunities for the
     exercise of their profession.

     5 Flash Molishers&mdash;a term given to low Prostitutes.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>said a tall man standing near them, "or b&mdash;&mdash; me if I don't mill
you."
</p>
<p>
"You mill me, vhy you don't know how to go about it, Mr. Bully Brag, and
I doesn't care half a farden for you&mdash;you go for to say as how I&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Take that, then," said the other, and gave him a floorer; but he was
prevented from falling by those around him.
</p>

The salute was returned in good earnest, and a random sort of fight
ensued. The accompaniments of this exhibition were the shrieks of the
women, and the shouts of the partisans of each of the Bruisers&mdash;the
cries of "Go it, little one&mdash;stick to it&mdash;tip it him&mdash;sarve him
out&mdash;ring, ring&mdash;give 'em room&mdash;foul, foul&mdash;fair, fair," &amp;c." At this
moment the Firemen, who had been actively engaged in endeavours to
subdue the devouring flames, obtained a supply of water: the engines
were set to work, and the Foreman directed the pipe so as to throw the
water completely into the mob which had collected round them. This had
the desired effect of putting an end to the squabble, and dispersing
a large portion of the multitude, at least to some distance, so as to
leave good and sufficient room for their operations.

<p>
"The Devil take it," cried Sparkle, "I am drench'd."
</p>
<p>
"Ditto repeated," said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Curse the fellow," cried Bob, "I am sopp'd."
</p>
<p>
"Never mind," continued Tom,
</p>
<pre>
          .  .  .  "By fellowship in woe,
          Scarce half our pain we know."
</pre>
<p>
"Since we are all in it, there is no laughing allowed."
</p>
<p>
In a short time, the water flowed through the street in torrents; the
pumping of the engines, and the calls of the Firemen, were all
the noises that could be heard, except now and then the arrival of
additional assistance.
</p>
<p>
Bob watched minutely the skill and activity of those robust and hardy
men, who were seen in all directions upon the tops of houses, &amp;c. near
the calamitous scene, giving information to those below; and he was
astonished to see the rapidity with which they effected their object.
</p>
<p>
Having ascertained as far as they could the extent of the damage,
and that no lives were lost, Tom proposed a move, and Sparkle gladly
seconded the motion&mdash;"for," said he, "I am so wet, though I cannot
complain of being <span class="pagenum">[151]</span>cold, that I think I resemble the fat man who
seemed something like two single gentlemen roll'd into one,' and 'who
after half a year's baking declared he had been so cursed hot, he was
sure he'd caught cold;' so come along."
</p>
<p>
"Past twelve o'clock," said a Charley, about three parts sprung, and
who appeared to have more light in his head than he could shew from his
lantern.
</p>
<p>
"Stop thief, stop thief," was vociferated behind them; and the night
music, the rattles, were in immediate use in several quarters&mdash;a rush of
the crowd almost knock'd Bob off his pins, and he would certainly have
fell to the ground, but his nob{l} came with so much force against the
bread-basket{2} of the groggy guardian of the night, that he was turn'd
keel upwards,{3} and rolled with his lantern, staff, and rattle, into
the overflowing kennel; a circumstance which perhaps had really no
bad effect, for in all probability it brought the sober senses of the
Charley a little more into action than the juice of the juniper had
previously allowed. He was dragged from his birth, and his coat, which
was of the blanket kind, brought with it a plentiful supply of the
moistening fluid, being literally sous'd from head to foot.
</p>
<p>
Bob fished for the <i>darkey</i>{4}&mdash;the <i>musical instrument</i>{5}&mdash;and the
post of honour, alias the <i>supporter of peace</i>;{6} but he was not yet
complete, for he had dropped his <i>canister-cap</i>,{7} which was at length
found by a flash molisher, and drawn from the pool, full of water, who
appeared to know him, and swore he was one of the best fellows on any of
the beats round about; and that they had got hold of a Fire-prigger,{8}
and bundled{9} him off to St. Giles's watch-house, because he was
bolting with a <i>bag of togs</i>.

     passenger will fly from the fire, and the traveller shall be
     protected by it; while these wretches, who attend on  fires,
     and rob the unfortunate  sufferers   under pretence of
     coming to give assistance, and assuming the style and manner
     of neighbours, take advantage of distress and confusion.
     Such wretches have a more eminent claim to the detestation
     of society, than almost any other of those who prey upon it.

<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>The feeble old scout shook his dripping wardrobe, d&mdash;&mdash;d the
water and the boosy kid that wallof'd him into it, but without appearing
to know which was him; till Bob stepped up, and passing some silver into
his mawley, told him he hoped he was not hurt. And our party then, moved
on in the direction for Russel-street, Covent-garden, when Sparkle again
mentioned his wet condition, and particularly recommended a glass of
Cogniac by way of preventive from taking cold. "A good motion well made
(said Tom;) and here we are just by the Harp, where we can be fitted to
a shaving; so come along."
</p>
<p>
Having taken this, as Sparkle observed, very necessary precaution,
they pursued their way towards Piccadilly, taking their route under the
Piazzas of Covent-garden, and thence up James-street into Long-acre,
where they were amused by a circumstance of no very uncommon kind in
London, but perfectly new to Tallyho. Two Charleys had in close custody
a sturdy young man (who was surrounded by several others,) and was
taking him to the neighbouring watch-house "What is the matter?" said
Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, 'tis only a little bit of a dead body-snatcher," said one of the
guardians. "He has been up to the resurrection rig.{1} Here," continued
he, "I've got the bone-basket,"
</p>
<pre>
     1 Resurrection rig&mdash;This subject, though a grave one, has
     been treated by many with a degree of comicality calculated
     to excite considerable risibility. A late well known
     humorist has related the following anecdote:

     Some young men, who had been out upon the spree, returning
     home pretty well primed after drinking plentifully, found
     themselves so dry as they passed a public house where they
     were well known, they could not resist the desire they had
     of calling on their old friend, and taking a glass of brandy
     with him by way of finish, as they termed it; and finding
     the door open, though it was late, were tempted to walk in.
     But their old friend was out of temper. "What is the
     matter?"&mdash;"Matter enough," replied Boniface; "here have I
     got an old fool of a fellow occupying my parlour dead drunk,
     and what the devil to do with him I don't know. He can
     neither walk nor speak."

     "Oh," said one of the party, who knew that a resurrection
     Doctor resided in the next street, "I'll remove that
     nuisance, if that's all you have to complain of; only lend
     me a sack, and I'll sell him."

     A sack  was   produced,  and   the   Bacchanalian,  who
     almost appeared void of animation, was without much
     difficulty thrust into it. "Give me a lift," said the
     frolicsome blade, and away he went with the load. On
     arriving at the doctor's door, he pulled the night bell,
     when the Assistant made his appearance, not un-accustomed to
     this sort of nocturnal visitant.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>holding up a bag, "and it was taken off his shoulder as he went
along Mercer-street, so he can't say nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
"I have brought you a subject&mdash;all right."
</p>
<p>
"Come in. What is it, a man or a woman?"
</p>
<p>
"A man."
</p>
<p>
"Down with him&mdash;that corner. D&mdash;&mdash;n it, I was fast asleep.
</p>
<p>
"Call for the sack in the morning, will you, for I want to get to bed."
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart."
</p>
<p>
Then going to a drawer, and bringing the customary fee, "Here, (said he)
be quick and be off." This was exactly what the other wanted; and having
secured the rubbish,{1} the door was shut upon him. This, however,
was no sooner done, than the Boosy Kid in the sack, feeling a sudden
internal turn of the contents of his stomach, which brought with it a
heaving, fell, from the upright situation in which he had been placed,
on the floor. This so alarmed the young Doctor, that he ran with all
speed after the vender, and just coming up to him at the corner of the
street.
</p>
<p>
"Why, (said he) you have left me a living man!"
</p>
<p>
"Never mind, (replied the other;) kill him when you want him." And
making good use of his heels he quickly disappeared.
</p>
<p>
A Comedian of some celebrity, but who is now too old for theatrical
service, relates a circumstance which occurred to him upon his first
arrival in town:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Having entered into an engagement to appear upon the boards of one of
the London Theatres, he sought the metropolis some short time before the
opening of the House; and conceiving it necessary to his profession
to study life&mdash;real life as it is,&mdash;he was accustomed to mingle
promiscuously in almost all society. With this view he frequently
entered the tap rooms of the lowest public houses, to enjoy his pipe and
his pint, keeping the main object always in view&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"To catch the manners living as they rise."
</p>
<p>
Calling one evening at one of these houses, not far from Drury Lane, he
found some strapping fellows engaged in conversation, interlarded with
much flash and low slang; but decently dressed, he mingled in a sort of
general dialogue with them on the state of the weather, politics, &amp;c.
After sitting some time in their company, and particularly noticing
their persons and apparent character&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
     "Come, Bill, it is time to be off, it is getting rather
     darkish." "Ah, very well (replied the other,) let us have
     another quart, and then I am your man for a bit of a lark."
     By this time they had learned that the Comedian was but
     newly arrived in town; and he on the other hand was desirous
     of seeing what they meant to be up to. After another quart
     they were about to move, when, said one to the other, "As we
     are only going to have a stroll and a bit of fun, perhaps
     that there young man would like to join us."

     "Ah, what say you, Sir? have you any objection? but perhaps
     you have business on hand and are engaged&mdash;"

     "No, I have nothing particular to do," was the reply. "Very
     well, then if you like to go with us, we shall be glad of
     your company."

     "Well (said he,) I don't care if I do spend an hour with
     you." And with that they sallied forth.

     After rambling about for some time in the vicinity of
     Tottenham Court Road, shewing him some of the Squares, &amp;c.
     describing the names of streets, squares, and buildings,
     they approached St. Giles's, and leading him under a
     gateway, "Stop, (said one) we must call upon Jack, you know,
     for old acquaintance sake," and gave a loud knock at the
     door; which being opened without a word, they all walked in,
     and the door was instantly lock'd. He was now introduced to
     a man of squalid appearance, with whom they all shook hands:
     the mode of introduction was not however of so satis-factory
     a description as had been expected, being very laconic, and
     conveyed in the following language:&mdash;"We have got him."

     "Yes, yes, it is all right&mdash;come, Jack, serve us out some
     grog, and then to business."

     The poor Comedian in the mean time was left in the utmost
     anxiety and surprise to form an opinion of his situation;
     for as he had heard something about trepanning, pressing,
     &amp;c. he could not help entertaining serious suspicion that he
     should either be com-pelled to serve as a soldier or a
     sailor; and as he had no intention "to gain a name in arms,"
     they were neither of them suitable to his inclinations.

     "Come," (said one) walk up stairs and sit down&mdash;Jack, bring
     the lush "&mdash;and up stairs they went.

     Upon entering a gloomy room, somewhat large, with only a
     small candle, he had not much opportunity of discovering
     what sort of a place it was, though it looked wretched
     enough. The grog was brought&mdash;"Here's all round the grave-
     stone, (said one)&mdash;come, drink away, my hearty&mdash;don't be
     alarm'd, we are rum fellows, and we'll put you up to a rig
     or two&mdash;we are got a rum covey in the corner there, and you
     must lend us a hand to get rid of him:" then, holding up the
     light, what was the surprise of the poor Comedian to espy a
     dead body of a man&mdash;"You can help us to get him away, and
     by G&mdash;&mdash;you shall, too, it's of no use to flinch now."

     A circumstance of this kind was new to him, so that his
     perplexity was only increased by the discovery; but he
     plainly perceived by the last declaration, that having
     engaged in the business, it would be of no use to leave it
     half done: he therefore remained silent upon the subject,
     drank his grog, when Jack came up stairs to say the cart was
     ready.

     "Lend a hand, (said one of them) let us get our load down
     stairs&mdash;come, my Master, turn to with a good heart, all's
     right."

     With this the body was conveyed down stairs.

     At the back of the house was a small yard separated from a
     neighbouring street by a wall&mdash;a signal was given by some
     one on the other side which was understood by those within&mdash;
     it was approaching nine o'clock, and a dark night&mdash;"Come,
     (said one of them,) mount you to the top of the wall, and
     ding the covey over to the carcass-carter." This being
     complied with, the dead body was handed up to him, which was
     no sooner done than the Carman outside, perceiving the
     Watchman approach&mdash;"It von't do," said he, and giving a
     whistle, drove his cart with an assumed air of carelessness
     away; while the poor Comedian, who had a new character to
     support, in which he did not conceive himself well up,{1}
     was holding the dead man on his lap with the legs projecting
     over the wall; it was a situation of the utmost delicacy and
     there was no time to recast the part, he was therefore,
     obliged to blunder through it as well as he could; the
     perspiration of the living man fell plentifully on the
     features of the dead as the Charley approached in a position
     to pass directly under him. Those inside had sought the
     shelter of the house, telling him to remain quiet till the
     old Scout was gone by. Now although he was not fully
     acquainted with the consequences of discovery, he was
     willing and anxious to avoid them: he therefore took the
     advice, and scarcely moved or breathed&mdash;"Past nine o'clock,"
     said the Watchman, as he passed under the legs of the dead
     body without looking up, though he was within an inch of
     having his castor brushed off by them. Being thus relieved,
     he was happy to see the cart return; he handed over the
     unpleasant burthen, and as quick as possible afterwards
     descended from his elevated situation into the street,
     determining at all hazards to see the result of this to him
     extraordinary adventure; with this view he followed the cart
     at a short distance, keeping his eye upon it as he went
     along; and in one of the streets leading to Long Acre, he
     perceived a man endeavouring to look into the back part of
     the cart, but was diverted from his object by one of the men
     who had introduced him to the house, while another of the
     confederates snatched the body from the cart, and ran with
     all speed down another street in an opposite direction. This
     movement had attracted the notice of the Watchman, who,
     being prompt in his movements, had sprung his rattle. Upon
     this, and feeling himself too heavily laden to secure his
     retreat, the fellow with the dead man perceiving the gate of
     an area open, dropped his burden down the steps, slam'd the
     gate after him, and continued to fly, but was stopped at the
     end of the street; in the mean time the Charley in pursuit
     had knock'd at the door of the house where the stolen goods
     (as he supposed) were deposited.

          1 A cant phrase for money.

     It was kept by an old maiden lady, who, upon discovering the
     dead body of a man upon her premises, had fainted in the
     Watchman's arms. The detection of the running
     Resurrectionist was followed by a walk to the watch-house,
     where his companions endeavoured to make it appear that they
     had all been dining at Wandsworth together, that he was not
     the person against whom the hue and cry had been raised. But
     <i>old Snoosey</i>{l} said it wouldn't do, and he was therefore
     detained to appear before the Magistrate in the morning. The
     Comedian, who had minutely watched their proceedings, took
     care to be at Bow-street in good time; where he found upon
     the affidavits of two of his comrades, who swore they had
     dined together at Wandsworth, their pal was liberated.

</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>Bob could not very well understand what was the meaning of this
lingo; he was perfectly at a loss to comprehend the terms of deadbody
snatching and the resurrection rig. The crowd increased as they went
along; and as they did not exactly relish their company, Sparkle led.
them across the way, and then proceeded to explain.
</p>
<p>
"Why," said Sparkle, "the custom of dead-body snatching has become
very common in London, and in many cases appears to be winked at by the
Magistrates; for although it is considered a felony in law, it is also
acknowledged in some degree to be necessary for the Surgeons, in
order to have an opportunity of obtaining practical information. It is
however, at the same time, a source of no slight distress to the parents
and friends of the parties who are dragg'd from the peaceful security of
the tomb. The <i>Resurrection-men</i> are generally well rewarded for their
labours by the Surgeons who employ them to procure subjects; they are
for the most part fellows who never stick at trifles, but make a decent
livelihood by moving off, if they can, not only the bodies, but coffins,
shrouds, &amp;c. and are always upon the look-out wherever there is a
funeral&mdash;nay, there have been instances in which the bodies have been
dug from their graves within a few hours after being deposited there."
</p>
<p>
"It is a shameful practice," said Bob, "and ought not to be tolerated,
however; nor can I conceive how, with the apparent vigilance of the
Police, it can be carried on."
</p>
<p>
"Nothing more easy," said Sparkle, "where the plan is well laid. These
fellows, when they hear a passing-bell toll, skulk about the parish from
ale-house to ale-house, till <span class="pagenum">[157]</span>they can learn a proper account of
what the deceased died of, what condition the body is in, &amp;c. with which
account they go to a <i>Resurrection Doctor</i>, who agrees for a price,
which is mostly five guineas, for the body of a man, and then bargain
with an Undertaker for the shroud, coffin, &amp;c. which, perhaps with a
little alteration, may serve to run through the whole family."
</p>
<p>
"And is it possible," said Bob, "that there are persons who will enter
into such bargains?"
</p>
<p>
"No doubt of it; nay, there was an instance of a man really selling his
own body to a Surgeon, to be appropriated to his own purposes when dead,
for a certain weekly sum secured to him while living; but in robbing
the church-yards there are always many engaged in the rig&mdash;for notice is
generally given that the body will be removed in the night, to which the
Sexton is made privy, and receives the information with as much ease as
he did to have it brought&mdash;his price being a guinea for the use of the
<i>grubbing irons</i>, adjusting the grave, &amp;c. This system is generally
carried on in little country church-yards within a few miles of London.
A hackney-coach or a cart is ready to receive the stolen property, and
there cannot be a doubt but many of these depredations are attended with
success, the parties escaping with their prey undetected&mdash;nay, I know
of an instance that occurred a short time back, of a young man who was
buried at Wesley's Chapel, on which occasion one of the mourners, a
little more wary than the rest, could not help observing two or three
rough fellows in the ground during the ceremony, which aroused his
suspicion that they intended after interment to have the body of his
departed friend; this idea became so strongly rooted in his mind, that
he imparted his suspicions to the remainder of those who had followed
him: himself and another therefore determined if possible to satisfy
themselves upon the point, by returning in the dusk of the evening to
reconnoitre. They accordingly proceeded to the spot, but the gates being
shut, one of them climbed to the top of the wall, where he discovered
the very parties, he had before noticed, in the act of wrenching open
the coffin. Here they are, said he, hard at it, as I expected. But
before he and his friend could get over the wall, the villains
effected their escape, leaving behind them a capacious sack and all the
implements of their infernal trade. They secured the body, had <span class="pagenum">[158]</span>it
conveyed home again, and in a few days re-buried it in a place of
greater security.{1}
</p>
<p>
Bob was surprised at this description of the <i>Resurrection-rig</i>, but was
quickly drawn from his contemplation of the depravity of human nature,
and what he could not help thinking the dirty employments of life, by
a shouting apparently from several voices as they passed the end of
St. Martin's Lane: it came from about eight persons, who appeared to be
journeymen mechanics, with pipes in their mouths, some of them rather
<i>rorytorious</i>,{2} who, as they approached, broke altogether into the
following
</p>
<pre>
          SONG.{3}

          "I'm a frolicsome young fellow, I live at my ease,
          I work when I like, and I play when I please;
          I'm frolicsome, good-natured&mdash;I'm happy and free,
          And I care not a jot what the world thinks of me.

          With my bottle and glass some hours I pass,
          Sometimes with my friend, and sometimes with my lass:
          I'm frolicsome, good-natur'd&mdash;I'm happy and free,
          And I don't care one jot what the world thinks of me.

          By the cares of the nation I'll ne'er be perplex'd,
          I'm always good-natur'd, e'en though I am vex'd;
          I'm frolicsome, good-humour'd&mdash;I'm happy and free,
          And I don't care one d&mdash;&mdash;n what the world thinks of me.

     1 A circumstance very similar to the one here narrated by
     Sparkle actually occurred, and can be well authenticated.

     2 Rorytorious&mdash;Noisy.

     3 This song is not introduced for the elegance of its
     composition, but as the Author has actually heard it in the
     streets at the flight of night or the peep of day, sung in
     full chorus, as plain as the fumes of the pipes and the
     hiccups would allow the choristers at those hours to
     articulate; and as it is probably the effusion of some
     Shopmate in unison with the sentiments of many, it forms
     part of Real Life deserving of being recorded in this Work.

     Particular trades have particular songs suitable to the
     employment in which they are engaged, which while at work
     the whole of the parties will join in. In Spitalfields,
     Bethnal-green, &amp;c. principally inhabited by weavers, it is
     no uncommon thing to hear twenty or thirty girls singing,
     with their shuttles going&mdash;The Death of Barbary Allen&mdash;There
     was an old Astrologer&mdash;Mary's Dream, or Death and the Lady;
     and we remember a Watch-maker who never objected to hear his
     boys sing; but although he was himself a loyal subject, he
     declared he could not bear God Save the King; and upon being
     ask'd his reason&mdash;Why, said he, it is too slow&mdash;for as the
     time goes, so the fingers move&mdash;Give us <i>Drops of Brandy</i>,
     or <i>Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself</i>&mdash;then I shall have
     some work done.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>This Song, which was repeated three or four times, was continued
till their arrival at Newport-market, where the Songsters divided: our
party pursued their way through Coventry-street, and arrived without
further adventure or interruption safely at home. Sparkle bade them
adieu, and proceeded to Bond-street; and Tom and Bob sought the repose
of the pillow.

It is said that "Music hath charms to sooth the savage breast," and it
cannot but be allowed that the <i>Yo heave ho</i>, of our Sailors, or the
sound of a fiddle, contribute much to the speed of weighing anchor.
</p>
<p>
It is an indisputable fact that there are few causes which more
decidedly form, or at least there are few evidences which more clearly
indicate, the true character of a nation, than its Songs and Ballads. It
has been observed by the learned Selden, that you may see which way the
wind sets by throwing a straw up into the air, when you cannot make the
same discovery by tossing up a stone or other weighty substance. Thus it
is with Songs and Ballads, respecting the state of public feeling, when
productions of a more elaborate nature fail in their elucidations: so
much so that it is related of a great Statesman, who was fully convinced
of the truth of the observation, that he said, "Give me the making of
the national Ballads, and I care not who frames your Laws." Every day's
experience tends to prove the power which the <i>sphere-born</i> Sisters of
harmony, voice, and verse, have over the human mind. "I would rather,"
says Mr. Sheridan, "have written Glover's song of 'Hosier's Ghost' than
the Annals of Tacitus."<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>

    CHAPTER XII
</h2>
<pre>
     O what a town, what a wonderful Metropolis!
     Sure such a town as this was never seen;
     Mayor, common councilmen, citizens and populace,
     Wand'ring from Poplar to Turnham Green.

     Chapels, churches, synagogues, distilleries and county banks&mdash;
     Poets, Jews and gentlemen, apothecaries, mountebanks&mdash;
     There's Bethlem Hospital, and there the Picture Gallery;
     And there's Sadler's Wells, and there the Court of Chancery.

     O such a town, such a wonderful Metropolis,
     Sure such a town as this was never seen!
     O such a town, and such a heap of carriages,
     Sure such a motley group was never seen;
     Such a swarm of young and old, of buryings and marriages,
     All the world seems occupied in ceaseless din.

     There's the Bench, and there's the Bank&mdash;now only take a peep at her&mdash;
     And there's Rag Fair, and there the East-London Theatre&mdash;
     There's St. James's all so fine, St. Giles's all in tattery,
     Where fun and frolic dance the rig from Saturday to Saturday.
     O what a town, what a wonderful Metropolis,
     Sure such a town as this was never seen!

<p>
A SHORT time after this day's ramble, the Hon. Tom Dash all and his
friend Tallyho paid a visit to the celebrated Tattersall's.

<p>
"This," said Tom, "is a great scene of action at times, and you will
upon some occasions find as much business done here as there is on
'Change; the dealings however are not so fair, though the profits
are larger; and if you observe the characters and the visages of the
visitants, it will be found it is most frequently attended by Turf-Jews
and Greeks.{1} Any man indeed who dabbles in horse-dealing, must, like
a gamester, be either a rook or a pigeon; {2} for horse-dealing is a
species of gambling, in which as many
</p>
<pre>
     1  Turf-Jews and Greeks&mdash;Gamblers at races, trotting-
     matches, &amp;c.

     2 Rooks and Pigeons are frequenters of gaming-houses: the
     former signifying the successful adventurer, and the latter
     the unfortunate dupe.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>depredations are committed upon the property of the unwary as in
any other, and every one engaged in it thinks it a meritorious act to
dupe his chapman. Even noblemen and gentlemen, who in other
transactions of life are honest, will make no scruple of cheating you in
horse-dealing: nor is this to be wondered at when we consider that
the Lord and the Baronet take lessons from their grooms, jockeys, or
coachmen, and the nearer approach they can make to the appearance
and manners of their tutors, the fitter the pupils for turf-men, or
gentlemen dealers; for the school in which they learn is of such
a description that dereliction of principle is by no means
surprising&mdash;fleecing each other is an every-day practice&mdash;every one
looks upon his fellow as a bite, and young men of fashion learn how to
buy and sell, from old whips, jockeys, or rum ostlers, whose practices
have put them up to every thing, and by such ruffian preceptors are
frequently taught to make three quarters or seventy-five per cent,
profit, which is called turning an honest penny. This, though frequently
practised at country fairs, &amp;c. by horse-jobbers, &amp;c. is here executed
with all the dexterity and art imaginable: for instance, you have
a distressed friend whom you know must sell; you commiserate his
situation, and very kindly find all manner of faults with his horse, and
buy it for half its value&mdash;you also know a Green-horn and an extravagant
fellow, to whom you sell it for twice its value, and that is the neat
thing. Again, if you have a horse you wish to dispose of, the same
school will afford you instruction how to make the most of him, that is
to say, to conceal his vices and defects, and by proper attention to put
him into condition, to alter his whole appearance by hogging, cropping,
and docking&mdash;by patching up his broken knees&mdash;blowing gun-powder in his
dim eyes&mdash;bishoping, blistering, &amp;c. so as to turn him out in good twig,
scarcely to be known by those who have frequently seen and noticed him:
besides which, at the time of sale one of these gentry will aid and
assist your views by pointing out his recommendations in some such
observations as the following:
</p>
<p>
'There's a horse truly good and well made.
</p>
<p>
'There's the appearance of a fine woman! broad breast, round hips, and
long neck.
</p>
<p>
'There's the countenance, intrepidity, and fire of a lion.
</p>
<p>
'There's the eye, joint, and nostril of an ox.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>'There's the nose, gentleness, and patience of a lamb.
</p>
<p>
'There's the strength, constancy, and foot of a mule.
</p>
<p>
'There's the hair, head, and leg of a deer.
</p>
<p>
'There's the throat, neck, and hearing of a wolf.
</p>
<p>
'There's the ear, brush, and trot of a fox.
</p>
<p>
'There's the memory, sight, and turning of a serpent.
</p>
<p>
'There's the running, suppleness, and innocence of the hare.
</p>
<p>
"And if a horse sold for sound wind, limb, and eyesight, with all the
gentleness of a lamb, that a child might ride him with safety, should
afterwards break the purchaser's neck, the seller has nothing to do with
it, provided he has received the <i>bit</i>,{1} but laughs at the <i>do</i>.{2}
Nay, they will sometimes sell a horse, warranted to go as steady as ever
a horse went in harness, to a friend, assuring him at the same time that
he has not a fault of any kind&mdash;that he is good as ever shoved a head
through a horse-collar; and if he should afterwards rear up in the gig,
and overturn the driver into a ditch, shatter the concern to
pieces, spill Ma'am, and kill both her and the child of promise, the
conscientious Horse-dealer has nothing to do with all this: How could
he help it? he sold the horse for a good horse, and a good horse he was.
This is all in the way of fair dealing. Again, if a horse is sold as
sound, and he prove broken-winded, lame, or otherwise, not worth
one fortieth part of the purchase-money, still it is only a piece of
jockeyship&mdash;a fair manouvre, affording opportunities of merriment."
</p>
<p>
"A very laudable sort of company," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"It is rather a mixed one," replied Tom&mdash;"it is indeed a complete
mixture of all conditions, ranks, and orders of society. But let us take
a peep at some of them. Do you observe that stout fellow yonder, with
a stick in his hand? he has been a <i>Daisy-kicker</i>, and, by his arts and
contrivances having saved a little money, is now a regular dealer, and
may generally be seen here on selling days."
</p>
<p>
"Daisy-kicker," said Bob, "I don't comprehend the term."
</p>
<p>
"Then I will explain," was the reply. "Daisy-kickers are Ostlers
belonging to large inns, who are known to each other by that title, and
you may frequently hear them
</p>
<pre>
     1 Bit&mdash;A cant term for money.

     2 Do&mdash;Any successful endeavour to over-reach another is by
     these gentlemen call'd a do, meaning&mdash;so and so has been
     done.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>ask&mdash;When did you sell your Daisy-kicker or Grogham?&mdash;for these
terms are made use of among themselves as cant for a horse. Do you also
observe, he is now in close conversation with a person who he expects
will become a purchaser."
</p>
<p>
"And who is he?"
</p>
<p>
"He is no other than a common informer, though in high life; keeps his
carriage, horses, and servants&mdash;lives in the first style&mdash;he is shortly
to be made a Consul of, and perhaps an Ambassador afterwards. The first
is to all intents and purposes a Lord of Trade, and his Excellency
nothing more than a titled spy, in the same way as a Bailiff is a
follower of the law, and a man out of livery a Knight's companion or a
Nobleman's gentleman."
</p>
<p>
Their attention was at this moment attracted by the appearance of two
persons dressed in the extreme of fashion, who, upon meeting just by
them, caught eagerly hold of each other's hand, and they overheard
the following&mdash;'Why, Bill, how am you, my hearty?&mdash;where have you
been <i>trotting your galloper</i>?&mdash;what is you arter?&mdash;how's Harry and
Ben?&mdash;haven't seen you this blue moon.'{1}
</p>
<p>
'All tidy,' was the reply; 'Ben is getting better, and is going to sport
a new curricle, which is now building for him in Long Acre, as soon as
he is recovered.'
</p>
<p>
'Why what the devil's the matter with him, eh?'
</p>
<p>
'Nothing of any consequence, only he got mill'd a night or two ago about
his blowen&mdash;he had one of his ribs broke, sprained his right wrist, and
sports a <i>painted peeper</i>{2} upon the occasion, that's all.'
</p>
<p>
'Why you know he's no <i>bad cock</i> at the Fancy, and won't put up with any
gammon.'
</p>
<p>
'No, but he was lushy, and so he got queer'd&mdash;But I say, have you sold
your bay?'
</p>
<p>
'No, d&mdash;&mdash;n me, I can't get my price.'
</p>
<p>
'Why, what is it you axes?'{3}
</p>
<p>
'Only a hundred and thirty&mdash;got by Agamemnon. Lord, it's no price at
all&mdash;cheap as dirt&mdash;But I say, Bill,
</p>
<pre>
     1 Blue moon&mdash;This is usually intended to imply a long time.

     2 Painted peeper&mdash;A black eye.

     3 Axes&mdash;Among the swell lads, and those who affect the
     characters of knowing coveys, there is a common practice of
     endeavouring to coin new words and new modes of expression,
     evidently intended to be thought wit; and this affectation
     frequently has the effect of creating a laugh.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>how do you come on with your grey, and the pie-bald poney?'
</p>
<p>
'All right and regular, my boy; matched the poney for a light curricle,
and I swapped{1} the grey for an entire horse&mdash;such a rum one&mdash;when
will you come and take a peep at him?&mdash;all bone, fine shape and action,
figure beyond compare&mdash;I made a rare good chop of it.'
</p>
<p>
'I'm glad to hear it; I'll make a survey, and take a ride with you the
first leisure day; but I'm full of business, no time to spare&mdash;I say,
are, you a dealer?'
</p>
<p>
'No, no, it won't do, I lost too much at the Derby&mdash;besides, I must go
and drive my Girl out&mdash;<i>Avait, that's the time of day</i>,{2} my boys&mdash;so
good by&mdash;But if you should be able to pick up a brace of clever
pointers, a prime spaniel, or a greyhound to match Smut, I'm your
man&mdash;buy for me, and all's right&mdash;price, you know, is out of the
question, I must have them if they are to be got, so look out&mdash;bid and
buy; but mind, nothing but prime will do for me&mdash;that's the time of day,
you know, d&mdash;&mdash;n me&mdash;so good by&mdash;I'm off.' And away he went.
</p>
<p>
"Some great sporting character, I suppose," said Bob&mdash;"plenty of money."
</p>
<p>
"No such thing," said Tom, drawing him on one side&mdash;"you will hardly
believe that Bill is nothing more than a Shopman to a Linen-draper,
recently discharged for malpractices; and the other has been a Waiter
at a Tavern, but is now out of place; and they are both upon the
sharp look-out to <i>gammon the flats</i>. The former obtains his present
livelihood by gambling&mdash;spends the most of his time in playing cards
with <i>greenhorns</i>, always to be picked up at low flash houses, at fairs,
races, milling-matches, &amp;c. and is also in the holy keeping of the
cast-off mistress of a nobleman whose family he was formerly in as a
<i>valet-de-chambre</i>. The other pretends to teach sparring in the City,
and occasionally has a benefit in the Minories, Duke's Place, and the
Fives Court."
</p>
<p>
"They talk it well, however," said Bob.
</p>
<pre>
     1 Swapp'd&mdash;Exchanged.

     2  That's the time of day&mdash;That's your sort&mdash;that's the
     barber&mdash;keep moving&mdash;what am you arter&mdash;what am you up to&mdash;
     there never was such times&mdash;that's the Dandy&mdash;Go along Bob,
     &amp;c. are ex-pressions that are frequently made use of by the
     people of the Metropolis; and indeed fashion seems almost to
     have as much to do with our language as with our dress or
     manners.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>"Words are but wind, many a proud word comes off a weak stomach,"
was the reply; "and you may almost expect not to hear a word of truth in
this place, which may be termed The Sporting Repository&mdash;it is the grand
mart for horses and for other fashionable animals&mdash;for expensive asses,
and all sorts of sporting-dogs, town-puppies, and second-hand
vehicles. Here bets are made for races and fights&mdash;matches are made up
here&mdash;bargains are struck, and engagements entered into, with as much
form, regularity, and importance, as the progress of parliamentary
proceedings&mdash;points of doubt upon all occasions of jockeyship are
decided here; and no man of fashion can be received into what is termed
polished society, without a knowledge of this place and some of the
visitors. The proceedings however are generally so managed, that the
ostlers, the jockeys, the grooms, and the dealers, come best off, from
a superiority of knowledge and presumed judgment&mdash;they have a method of
patching up deep matches to <i>diddle the dupes</i>, and to introduce <i>throws
over, doubles, double doubles</i>, to ease the heavy pockets of their
burdens. The system of puffing is also as much in use here as among the
Lottery-office Keepers, the Quack Doctors, or the Auctioneers; and
the __Knowing ones, by an understanding amongst each other, sell their
cattle almost for what they please, if it so happens they are not
immediately in want of the <i>ready</i>,{1} which, by the way, is an article
too frequently in request&mdash;and here honest poverty is often obliged to
sell at any rate, while the rich black-leg takes care only to sell to
a good advantage, making a point at the same time not only to make the
most of his cattle, but also of his friend or acquaintance."
</p>
<p>
"Liberal and patriotic-minded men!" said Bob; "it is a noble Society,
and well worthy of cultivation."
</p>
<p>
"It is fashionable Society, at least," continued Tom, "and deserving of
observation, for it is fraught with instruction."
</p>
<p>
"I think so, indeed," was the reply; "but I really begin to suspect that
I shall scarcely have confidence to venture out alone, for there does
not appear to be any part of your wonderful Metropolis but what is
infested with some kind of shark or other."
</p>
<p>
"It is but too true, and it is therefore the more necessary to make
yourself acquainted with them; it is rather a long lesson, but really
deserving of being learnt. You

<pre>
     1 The ready&mdash;Money.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>perceive what sort of company you are now in, as far as may be
judged from their appearances; but they are not to be trusted, for I
doubt not but you would form erroneous conclusions from such premises.
The company that assembles here is generally composed of a great variety
of characters&mdash;the Idler, the Swindler, the Dandy, the Exquisite, the
full-pursed young Peer, the needy Sharper, the gaudy Pauper, and the
aspiring School-boy, anxious to be thought a dealer and a judge of the
article before him&mdash;looking at a horse with an air of importance and
assumed intelligence, bidding with a trembling voice and palpitating
heart, lest it should be knock'd down to him. Do you see that dashing
fellow nearly opposite to us, in the green frock-coat, top-boots, and
spurs?&mdash;do you mark how he nourishes his whip, and how familiar he seems
to be with the knowing old covey in brown?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes; I suppose he is a dealer."
</p>
<p>
"You are right, he is a dealer, but it is in man's flesh, not horse
flesh: he is a <i>Bum trap</i>{1} in search of some friend
</p>
<pre>
     1 Bum trap&mdash;A term pretty generally in use to denominate a
     Bailiff or his follower&mdash;they are also called Body-
     snatchers. The ways and means made use of by these gentry to
     make their captions are innumerable: they visit all places,
     assume all characters, and try all stratagems, to secure
     their friends, in order that they may have an opportunity of
     obliging them, which they have a happy facility in doing,
     provided the party can <i>bleed free</i>.* Among others, the
     following are curious facts:

     A Gentleman, who laboured under some peculiar difficulties,
     found it desirable for the sake of his health to retire into
     the country, where he secluded himself pretty closely from
     the vigilant anxieties of his friends, who were in search of
     him and had made several fruitless attempts to obtain an
     interview. The Traps having ascertained the place of his
     retreat, from which it appeared that nothing but stratagem
     could draw him, a knowing old snatch determined to effect
     his purpose, and succeeded in the following manner:

     One day as the Gentleman came to his window, he discovered a
     man, seemingly in great agitation, passing and re-passing;
     at length, however, he stopped suddenly, and with a great
     deal of attention fixed his eyes upon a tree which stood
     nearly opposite to the window. In a few minutes he returned
     to it, pulled out a book, in which he read for a few
     minutes, and then drew forth a rope from his pocket, with
     which he suspended himself from the tree. The Gentleman,
     eager to save the life of a fellow-creature, ran out and cut
     him down. This was scarcely accomplished, before he found
     the man whom he had rescued (as he thought) from death,
     slapp'd him on the shoulder, informed him that he was his
     prisoner, and in return robbed him of his liberty!

     Another of these gentry assumed the character of a poor
     cripple, and stationed himself as a beggar, sweeping the
     crossing near the habitation of his shy cock, who,
     conceiving himself safe after three days voluntary
     imprisonment, was seized by the supposed Beggar, who threw
     away his broom to secure his man.

     Yet, notwithstanding the many artifices to which this
     profession is obliged to conform itself, it must be
     acknowledged there are many of them who have hearts that
     would do honour to more exalted situations; especially when
     we reflect, that in general, whatever illiberality or
     invective may be cast upon them, they rarely if at all
     oppress those who are in their custody, and that they
     frequently endeavour to compromise for the Debtor, or at
     least recommend the Creditor to accept of those terms which
     can be complied with.

          * Bleed free&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>or other, with a writ in his pocket. These fellows have some
protean qualities about them, and, as occasion requires, assume all
shapes for the purpose of taking care of their customers; they are
however a sort of necessary evil. The old one in brown is a well-known
dealer, a deep old file, and knows every one around him&mdash;he is up to the
sharps, down upon the flats, and not to be done. But in looking round
you may perceive men booted and spurred, who perhaps never crossed
a horse, and some with whips in their hands who deserve it on their
backs&mdash;they hum lively airs, whistle and strut about with their
quizzing-glasses in their hands, playing a tattoo upon their boots, and
shewing themselves off with as many airs as if they were real actors
engaged in the farce, that is to say, the buyers and sellers; when in
truth they are nothing but loungers in search of employment, who
may perhaps have to count the trees in the Park for a dinner without
satisfying the cravings of nature, dining as it is termed with Duke
Humphrey&mdash;others, perhaps, who have arrived in safety, are almost afraid
to venture into the streets again, lest they should encounter those foes
to liberty, John Doe and Richard Roe."
</p>
<p>
'If I do, may I be&mdash;&mdash;' The remainder of the sentence was lost, by the
speaker removing in conversation with another, when Tom turn'd round.
</p>
<p>
"O," said Tom, "I thought I knew who it was&mdash;that is one of the greatest
reprobates in conversation that I ever met with."
</p>
<p>
"And who is he?"
</p>
<p>
"Why, I'll give you a brief sketch of him," continued Dashall: "It is
said, and I fancy pretty well known, <span class="pagenum">[168]</span>that he has retired upon a
small property, how acquired or accumulated I cannot say; but he has
married a Bar-maid of very beautiful features and elegant form: having
been brought up to the bar, she is not unaccustomed to confinement; but
he has made her an absolute prisoner, for he shuts her up as closely as
if she were in a monastery&mdash;he never dines at home, and she is left in
complete solitude. He thinks his game all safe, but she has sometimes
escaped the vigilance of her gaoler, and has been seen at places distant
from home.{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 It is related of this gentleman, whose severity and
     vigilance were so harshly spoken of, that one day at table,
     a dashing young Military Officer, who, while he was
     circulating the bottle, was boasting among his dissipated
     friends of his dexterity in conducting the wars of Venus,
     that he had a short time back met one of the most lovely
     creatures he ever saw, in the King's Road; but he had
     learned that her husband so strictly confined and watched
     her, that there was no possibility of his being admitted to
     her at any hour.

     "Behave handsome, and I'll put you in possession of a gun
     that shall bring the game down in spite of locks, bolts and
     bars, or even the vigilance of the eyes of Argus himself."

     "How? d&mdash;&mdash;me if I don't stand a ten pound note."

     "How! why easy enough; I've a plan that cannot but succeed&mdash;
     down with the cash, and I'll put you up to the scheme."

     No sooner said than done, and he pocketed the ten pound
     note.

     "Now," said the hoary old sinner, little suspecting that he
     was to be the dupe of his own artifice: "You get the husband
     invited out to dinner, have him well ply'd with wine by your
     friends: You assume the dress of a Postman&mdash;give a
     thundering rap at her door, which always denotes either the
     arrival of some important visitor or official communication;
     and when you can see her, flatter, lie, and swear that her
     company is necessary to your existence&mdash;that life is a
     burden without her&mdash;tell her, you know her husband is
     engaged, and can't come&mdash;that he is dining out with some
     jolly lads, and can't possibly be home for some hours&mdash;fall
     at her feet, and say that, having obtained the interview,
     you will not leave her. Your friends in the mean time must
     be engaged in making him as drunk as a piper. That's the way
     to do it, and if you execute it as well as it is plann'd,
     the day's your own."

     "Bravo, bravo!" echoed from every one present.

     It was a high thing&mdash;the breach thus made, the horn-work was
     soon to be carried, and there could be no doubt of a safe
     lodgement in the covert-way.

     The gay Militaire met his inamorata shortly afterwards in
     Chelsea-fields, and after obtaining from her sundry
     particulars of inquiry, as to the name of her husband, &amp;c.
     he acquainted her with his plan. The preliminaries were
     agreed upon, and it was deter-mined that the maid-servant,
     who was stationed as a spy upon her at all times, should be
     dispatched to some house in the neighbour-hood to procure
     change, while the man of letters was to be let in and
     concealed; and upon her return it was to be stated that the
     Postman was in a hurry, could not wait, and was to call
     again. This done, he was to make his escape by a rope-ladder
     from the window as soon as the old one should be heard upon
     the stairs, which it of course was presumed would be at a
     late hour, when he was drunk.

     The train having been thus laid, Old Vigilance dined out,
     and expected to meet the Colonel; but being disappointed,
     and suspicious at all times, for

          "Suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind,"

     The utmost endeavours of the party to make him drunk proved
     ineffectual; he was restless and uncomfortable, and he could
     not help fancying by the visible efforts to do him up, that
     some mischief was brewing, or some hoax was about to be
     played off. He had his master-key in his pocket, and retired
     early.

     His Lady, whose plan had succeeded admirably at home, was
     fearful of having the door bolted till after twelve, lest
     the servant's suspicions should be aroused. In the mean
     time, the son of Mars considered all safe, and entertained
     no expectation of the old Gentleman's return till a very
     late hour. When lo and behold, to the great surprise and
     annoyance of the lovers, he gently opened the street door,
     and fearful of awaking his faithful charmer out of her first
     slumber, he ascended the stairs unshod. His phosphoric
     matches shortly threw a light upon the subject, and he
     entered the apartment; when, what was the surprise and
     astonishment of the whole party at the discovery of their
     situation!

     The old Gentleman swore, stormed, and bullied, declaring he
     would have satisfaction! that he would commence a civil
     suit! The Military Hero told him it would be too civil by
     half, and was in fact more than he expected;&mdash;reminded him
     of the ten pounds he had received as agency for promoting
     his amours;&mdash;informed him he had performed the character
     recommended by him most admirably. The old man was almost
     choked with rage; but perceiving he had spread a snare for
     himself, was compelled to hear and forbear, while the lover
     bolted, wishing him a good night, and singing, "Locks,
     bolts, and bars, I defy you," as an admirable lesson in
     return for the blustering manner in which he had received
     information of the success of his own scheme.
</pre>
<p>
"Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; on the opposite side is a Money-procurer or lender, a very
accommodating sort of person, who négociâtes meetings and engagements
between young borrowers, who care not what they pay for money, and old
lenders, who care not who suffers, so they can obtain enormous interest
for their loans. He is a venerable looking man, and is known to most
of the young Bloods who visit here. His father was a German Cook in a
certain kitchen. He set up for a Gentleman at his father's death, and
was taken particular notice of by Lord G&mdash;&mdash;, <span class="pagenum">[170]</span>and indeed by all
the turf. He lived a gay and fashionable life, soon run out his fortune,
and is now pensioned by a female whom he formerly supported. He is an
excellent judge of a horse and horse-racing, upon which subjects
his advice is frequently given. He is a very useful person among the
generality of gentry who frequent this place of public resort. At the
same time it ought to be observed, that among the various characters
which infest and injure society, perhaps there are few more practised in
guilt, fraud, and deceit, than the Money-lenders.
</p>
<p>
"They advertise to procure large sums of money to assist those under
pecuniary embarrassment. They generally reside in obscure situations,
and are to be found by anonymous signatures, such as A. B. I. R. D. V.
&amp;c. They chiefly prey upon young men of property, who have lost their
money at play, horse-racing, betting, &amp;c. or other expensive amusements,
and are obliged to raise more upon any terms until their rents or
incomes become payable: or such as have fortunes in prospect, as being
heirs apparent to estates, but who require assistance in the mean time.
</p>
<p>
"These men avail themselves of the credit, or the ultimate
responsibility of the giddy and thoughtless young spendthrift in his
eager pursuit of criminal pleasures, and under the influence of those
allurements, which the various places of fashionable resort hold out;
and seldom fail to obtain from them securities and obligations for large
sums; upon the credit of which they are enabled, perhaps at usurious
interest, to borrow money or discount bills, and thus supply their
unfortunate customers upon the most extravagant terms.
</p>
<p>
"There are others, who having some capital, advance money upon bonds,
title-deeds, and other specialties, or tipon the bond of the parties
having property in reversion. By these and other devices, large sums of
money are most unwarrantably and illegally wrested from the dissipated
and the thoughtless; and misery and distress are perhaps entailed upon
them as long as they live, or they are driven by the prospect of utter
ruin to acts of desperation or the commission of crimes.
</p>
<p>
"It generally happens upon application to the advertising party, that
he, like Moses in <i>The School for Scandal</i>, is not really in possession
of any money himself, but then he knows where and how to procure it from
a very <span class="pagenum">[171]</span>unconscionable dog, who may, perhaps, not be satisfied with
the security ottered; yet, if you have Bills at any reasonable date, he
could get them discounted. If you should suffer yourself to be trick'd
out of any Bills, he will contrive, in some way or other, to negotiate
them&mdash;not, as he professes, for you, but for himself and his colleagues;
and, very likely, after you have been at the additional expense of
commencing a suit at law against them, they have disappeared, and are
in the King's Bench or the Fleet, waiting there to defraud you of
every hope and expectation, by obtaining their liberty through the
White-washing Act.
</p>
<p>
"These gentry are for the most part Attorneys or Pettifoggers, or
closely connected with such; and notwithstanding all legal provisions
to preclude them from exacting large sums, either for their agency and
introduction, or for the bonds which they draw, yet they contrive to
bring themselves home, and escape detection, by some such means as the
following:
</p>
<p>
"They pretend that it is necessary to have a deed drawn up to explain
the uses of the Annuity-bond, which the grantor of the money, who is
some usurious villain, immediately acknowledges and accedes to; for
</p>
<p>
"The bond that signs the mortgage pays the shot; so that an Act which
is fraught with the best purposes for the protection of the honest, but
unfortunate, is in this manner subjected to the grossest chicanery of
pettifoggers and pretenders, and the vilest evasions of quirking low
villains of the law.
</p>
<p>
"There is also another species of money-lender, not inaptly termed
the Female Banker. These accommodate Barrow-women and others, who sell
fruit, vegetables, &amp;c. in the public streets, with five shillings a day
(the usual diurnal stock in such cases;) for the use of which for twelve
hours they obtain the moderate premium of sixpence when the money is
returned in the evening, receiving at this rate about seven pounds
ten shillings per year for every five pounds they can so employ. It is
however very difficult to convince the borrowers of the correctness
of this calculation, and of the serious loss to which they subject
themselves by a continuation of the system, since it is evident that
this improvident and dissolute class of people have no other idea
than that of making the day and the way alike long. Their profits
<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>(often considerably augmented by dealing in base money as well as
the articles which they sell) seldom last over the day; for they never
fail to have a luxurious dinner and a hot supper, with a plentiful
supply of gin and porter: looking in general no farther than to keep the
whole original stock with the sixpence interest, which is paid over
to the female Banker in the evening, and a new loan obtained on the
following morning to go to market, and to be disposed of in the same
way.
</p>
<p>
"In contemplating this curious system of banking, or money lending
(trifling as it may appear,) it is almost impossible not to be forcibly
struck with the immense profits that are derived from it. It is only
necessary for one of these sharpers to possess a capital of seventy
shillings, or three pounds ten shillings, with fourteen steady and
regular customers, in order to realize an income of one hundred guineas
per year! So true it is, that one half of the world do not know how
the other half live; for there are thousands who cannot have the least
conception of the existence of such facts.
</p>
<p>
"Here comes a <i>Buck of the first cut</i>, one who pretends to know every
thing and every body, but thinks of nobody but himself, and of that self
in reality knows nothing.
</p>
<p>
Captain P&mdash;&mdash;is acknowledged by all his acquaintance to be one of the
best fellows in the world, and to beat every one at slang, but U&mdash;&mdash;y
and A&mdash;&mdash;se. He is the terror of the Charleys, and of the poor
unfortunate roofless nightly wanderers in the streets. You perceive his
long white hair, and by no means engaging features. Yet he has vanity
enough to think himself handsome, and that he is taken notice of on
that account; when the attractions he presents are really such as excite
wonder and surprise, mingled with disgust; yet he contemplates his
figure in the looking-glass with self satisfaction, and asks the
frail ones, with a tremulous voice, if, so help them&mdash;&mdash;he is not a
good-looking fellow 1 and they, knowing their customer, of course do not
fail to reply in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>
"He is a well known leg, and is no doubt present on this occasion to
bet upon the ensuing Epsom races; by the bye his losses have been very
considerable in that way. He has also at all times been a dupe to the
sex. It is said that Susan B&mdash;&mdash;, a dashing Cyprian, eased his purse
of a £500 bill, and whilst he was dancing in pursuit of her, she was
dancing to the tune of a Fife; a clear proof she <span class="pagenum">[173]</span>had an ear for
music as well as an eye to business. But I believe it was played in a
different Key to what he expected; whether it was a minor Key or not I
cannot exactly say.
</p>
<p>
"At a ball or assembly he conceives himself quite at home, satisfied
that he is the admiration of the whole of the company present; and were
he to give an account of himself, it would most likely be in substance
nearly as follows:
</p>
<p>
"When I enter the room, what a whisp'ring is heard; My rivals,
astonish'd, scarce utter a word; "How charming! (cry all; ) how
enchanting a fellow! How neat are those small-clothes, how killingly
yellow. Not for worlds would I honour these plebs with a smile, Tho'
bursting with pride and delight all the while; So I turn to my cronies
(a much honour'd few,); Crying, "S&mdash;z&mdash;m, how goes it?&mdash;Ah, Duchess,
how do? Ton my life, yonder's B&mdash;uf, and Br&mdash;ke, and A&mdash;g&mdash;le, S-ff&mdash;d,
W&mdash;tm&mdash;1&mdash;d, L&mdash;n, and old codger C&mdash;ri&mdash;le." Now tho', from this style
of address, it appears That these folks I have known for at least fifty
years, The fact is, my friends, that I scarcely know one, A mere "façon
de parler," the way of the ton. What tho' they dislike it, I answer my
ends, Country gentlemen stare, and suppose them my friends.
</p>
<p>
But my beautiful taste (as indeed you will guess) Is manifest most in my
toilet and dress; My neckcloth of course forms my principal care, For
by that we criterions of elegance swear, And costs me each morning some
hours of flurry, To make it appear to be tied in a hurry. My boot-tops,
those unerring marks of a blade, With Champagne are polish'd, and peach
marmalade; And a violet coat, closely copied from B&mdash;ng, With a
cluster of seals, and a large diamond ring; And troisièmes of buckskin,
bewitchingly large, Give the finishing stroke to the "<i>parfait
ouvrage</i>."
</p>
<p>
During this animated description of the gay personage alluded to, Bob
had listened with the most undeviating attention, keeping his eye all
the time on this extravagant piece of elegance and fashion, but could
not help bursting into an immoderate fit of laughter at its conclusion.
In the mean time the crowd of visitors had continued to increase; all
appeared to be bustle and confusion; small parties were seen in groups
communicating together in different places, and every face appeared
to be animated by hopes or fears. Dashall was exchanging familiar
<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>nods and winks with those whom lie knew; but as their object was
not to buy, they paid but little attention to the sales of the day,
rather contenting themselves with a view of the human cattle by which
they were surrounded, when they were pleasingly surprised to observe
their friend Sparkle enter, booted and spurred.
</p>
<p>
"Just the thing! (said Sparkle,) I had some suspicion of finding you
here. Are you buyers? Does your Cousin want a horse, an ass, or a
filly?"
</p>
<p>
Tom smiled; "Always upon the ramble, eh, Sparkle. Why ask such
questions? You know we are well horsed; but I suppose if the truth was
known, you are <i>prad</i> sellers; if so, shew your article, and name your
price."
</p>
<p>
"Apropos," said Sparkle; "Here is a friend of mine, to whom I must
introduce you, so say no more about articles and prices&mdash;I have an
article in view above all price&mdash;excuse me." And with this he made his
way among the tribe of Jockeys, Sharpers, and Blacklegs, and in a minute
returned, bringing with him a well-dressed young man, whose manners and
appearance indicated the Gentleman, and whose company was considered by
Tom and his Cousin as a valuable acquisition.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Richard Mortimer," said Sparkle, as he introduced his friend&mdash;"the
Hon. Mr. Dashall, and Mr. Robert Tallyho."
</p>
<p>
After the mutual interchanges of politeness which naturally succeeded
this introduction&mdash;"Come," said Sparkle, "we are horsed, and our nags
waiting&mdash;we are for a ride, which way do you bend your course?"
</p>
<p>
"A lucky meeting," replied Tom; "for we are upon the same scent; I
expect my curricle at Hyde-Park Corner in ten minutes, and have no
particular line of destination."
</p>
<p>
"Good," said Sparkle; "then we may hope to have your company; and how
disposed for the evening?"
</p>
<p>
"Even as chance may direct."
</p>
<p>
"Good, again&mdash;all right&mdash;then as you are neither buyers nor sellers,
let us employ the remaining ten minutes in looking around us&mdash;there
is nothing to attract here&mdash;Epsom Races are all the talk, and all of
business that is doing&mdash;come along, let us walk through the Park&mdash;let
the horses meet us at Kensington Gate, and then for a twist among the
briers and brambles."
</p>
<p>
This was readily agreed to: orders were given to the servants, and the
party proceeded towards the Park.<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>

<h2>
    CHAPTER XIII
</h2>
<pre>
     What is Bon Ton?   Oh d&mdash;&mdash; me (cries a Buck,
     Half drunk, ) ask me, my dear, and you're in luck:
     Bon Ton's to swear, break windows, beat the Watch,
     Pick up a wench, drink healths, and roar a catch.
     Keep it up, keep it up!   d&mdash;&mdash; me, take your swing&mdash;
     Bon Ton is Life, my boy! Bon Ton's the thing!
     "Ah, I loves Life and all the joys it yields&mdash;
     (Says Madam Fussock. warm from Spitalfields; )
     Bon Ton's the space 'twixt Saturday and Monday,
     And riding out in one-horse shay o' Sunday;
     'Tis drinking tea on summer afternoons
     At Bagnigge Wells, with china and gilt spoons;
     'Tis laying by our stuffs, red cloaks and pattens,
     To dance cowtillions all in silks and satins."
     "Vulgar! (cries Miss) observe in higher Life
     The feather'd spinster and three feather'd wife;
     The Club's Bon Ton&mdash;Bon Ton's a constant trade
     Of rout, festino, ball and masquerade;
     'Tis plays and puppet shows&mdash;'tis something new&mdash;
     'Tis losing thousands every night at loo;
     Nature it thwarts, and contradicts all reason;
     'Tis stiff French stays, and fruit when out of season,
     A rose, when half a guinea is the price;
     A set of bays scarce bigger than six mice;
     To visit friends you never wish to see&mdash;
     Marriage 'twixt those who never can agree;
     Old dowagers, dress'd, painted, patch'd and curl'd&mdash;
     This is Bon Ton, and this we call the World!
</pre>
<p>
AS they passed through the gate, Tom observed it was rather too early to
expect much company. "Never mind," said Sparkle, "we are company enough
among ourselves; the morning is fine, the curricle not arrived, and we
shall find plenty of conversation, if we do not discover interesting
character, to diversify our promenade. Travelling spoils conversation,
unless you are squeezed like an Egyptian mummy into a stage or a
mail-coach; and perhaps in that case you may meet with animals who have
voices, without possessing the power of intellect to direct them to any
useful or agreeable purpose."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>Tallyho, who was at all times delighted with Sparkle's
descriptions of society and manners, appeared pleased with the
proposition.
</p>
<p>
"Your absence from town," continued Sparkle, addressing himself to
Dashall, "has prevented my introduction of Mr. Mortimer before, though
you have heard me mention his Sister. They are now inhabitants of our
own sphere of action, and I trust we shall all become better known to
each other."
</p>
<p>
This piece of information appeared to be truly acceptable to all
parties. Young Mortimer was a good-looking and well made young man; his
features were animated and intelligent; his manners polished, though
not quite so unrestrained as those which are to be acquired by an
acquaintance with metropolitan associations.
</p>
<p>
"I am happy," said he, "to be introduced to any friends of your's, and
shall be proud to number them among mine."
</p>
<p>
"You may," replied Sparkle, "with great safety place them on your list;
though you know I have already made it appear to you that friendship is
a term more generally made use of than understood in London&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "For what is Friendship but a name,
          A charm which lulls to sleep,
          A shade that follows wealth and fame,
          And leaves the wretch to weep?

          And Love is still an emptier sound,
          The modern fair one's jest;
          On earth unseen, or only found
          To warm the turtle's nest."
</pre>
<p>
"These sentiments are excellently expressed," said Tom, pinching him by
the arm&mdash;"and I suppose in perfect consonance with your own?"
</p>
<p>
Sparkle felt 'the rebuke, look'd down, and seem'd confused; but in a
moment recovering himself,
</p>
<p>
"Not exactly so," replied he; "but then you know, and I don't
mind confessing it among friends, though you are aware it is very
unfashionable to acknowledge the existence of any thing of the kind, I
am a pupil of nature."
</p>
<p>
"You seem to be in a serious humour all at once," said young Mortimer.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>"Can't help it," continued Sparkle&mdash;"for,
</p>
<pre>
          "Let them all say what they will,
          Nature will be nature still."
</pre>
<p>
"And that usurper, or I should rather say, would be usurper, Fashion,
is in no way in alliance with our natures. I remember the old Duchess of
Marlborough used to say 'That to love some persons very much, and to
see often those we love, is the greatest happiness I can enjoy;' but
it appears almost impossible for any person in London to secure such an
enjoyment, and I can't help feeling it."
</p>
<p>
By the look and manner with which this last sentiment was uttered, Tom
plainly discovered there was a something labouring at his heart which
prompted it. "Moralizing!" said he. "Ah, Charley, you are a happy
fellow. I never yet knew one who could so rapidly change '<i>from grave to
gay, from lively to severe</i>; and for the benefit of our friends, I can't
help thinking you could further elucidate the very subject you have so
feelingly introduced."
</p>
<p>
"You are a quiz" said Sparkle; "but there is one thing to be said,
I know you, and have no great objection to your hits now and then,
provided they are not knock down blows."
</p>
<p>
"But," said Mortimer, "what has this to do with friendship and love? I
thought you were going to give something like a London definition of the
terms."
</p>
<p>
"Why," said Sparkle, "in London it is equally difficult to get to love
any body very much, or often to meet those that we love. There are such
numbers of acquaintances, such a constant succession of engagements of
one sort or other, such a round of delights, that the town resembles
Vauxhall, where the nearest and dearest friends may walk round and round
all night without once meeting: for instance, at dinner you should see a
person whose manners and conversation are agreeable and pleasing to you;
you may wish in vain to become more intimate, for the chance is, that
you will not meet so as to converse a second time for many months;
for no one can tell when the dice-box of society may turn up the same
numbers again. I do not mean to infer that you may not barely see the
same features again; it is possible that you may catch a glimpse of them
on the opposite side of Pall <span class="pagenum">[178]</span>Mall or Bond-street, or see them near
to you at a crowded rout, without a possibility of approaching.
</p>
<p>
"It is from this cause, that those who live in London are so totally
indifferent to each other; the waves follow so quick, that every vacancy
is immediately filled up, and the want is not perceived. The well-bred
civility of modern times, and the example of some 'very popular people,'
it is true, have introduced a shaking of hands, a pretended warmth, a
dissembled cordiality, into the manners of the cold and warm, alike
the dear friend and the acquaintance of yesterday. Consequently we
continually hear such conversation as the following:&mdash;' Ah, how d'ye do?
I'm delighted to see you! How is Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p>
<p>
'She's very well, thank you.' 'Has she any increase in family?' 'Any
increase! why I've only been married three months. I see you are talking
of my former wife: bless you, she has been dead these three years.'&mdash;Or,
'Ah, my dear friend, how d'ye do? You have been out of town some time;
where have you been? In Norfolk?' 'No, I have been two years in India.'"
</p>
<p>
This description of a friendly salutation appeared to interest and
amuse both Talltho and Mortimer. Tom laughed, shrugg'd up his shoulders,
acknowledged the picture was too true, and Sparkle continued.
</p>
<p>
"And thus it is, that, ignorant of one another's interests and
occupations, the generality of friendships of London contain nothing
more tender than a visiting card: nor are they much better, indeed they
are much worse, if you renounce the world, and determine to live only
with your relations and nearest connexions; for if you go to see them
at one o'clock, they are not stirring; at two, the room is full of
different acquaintances, who talk over the occurrences of the last
night's ball, and, of course, are paid more attention to than yourself;
at three, they are out shopping; at four, they are in this place dashing
among the Pinks, from which they do not return till seven, then they are
dressing; at eight, they are dining with two dozen friends; at nine and
ten the same; at eleven, they are dressing for the ball; and at twelve,
when you are retiring to rest, they are gone into society for the
evening: so that you are left in solitude; you soon begin again to try
the world&mdash;and we will endeavour to discover what it produces.
</p>
<p>
"The first inconvenience of a London Life is the late <span class="pagenum">[179]</span>hour of a
fashionable dinner. To pass the day in fasting, and then sit down to a
great dinner at eight o'clock, is entirely against the first dictates of
common sense and common stomachs. But what is to be done? he who rails
against the fashion of the times will be considered a most unfashionable
dog, and perhaps I have already said more than sufficient to entitle me
to that appellation."
</p>
<p>
"Don't turn <i>King's Evidence</i> against yourself," said Tom; "for, if you
plead guilty in this happy country, you must be tried by your Peers."
</p>
<p>
"Nay," said Mortimer, "while fashion and reason appear to be in such
direct opposition to each other, I must confess their merits deserve
to be impartially tried; though I cannot, for one moment, doubt but the
latter must ultimately prevail with the generality, however her dictates
may be disregarded by the votaries of the former."
</p>
<p>
"You are a good one at a ramble" said Tom, "and not a bad one in a
spree, but I cannot help thinking you are rambling out of your road;
you seem to have lost the thread of your subject, and, having been
disappointed with love and friendship, you are just going to sit down to
dinner."
</p>
<p>
"Pardon me," replied Sparkle, "I was proceeding naturally, and not
fashionably, to my subject; but I know you are so great an admirer of
the latter, that you care but little about the former."
</p>
<p>
"Hit for hit," said Tom; "but go on&mdash;you are certainly growing old,
Sparkle; at all events, you appear very grave this morning, and if
you continue in this humour long, I shall expect you are about taking
Orders."
</p>
<p>
"There is a time for all things, but the time for that has not yet
arrived."
</p>
<p>
"Well, then, proceed without sermonizing."
</p>
<p>
"I don't like to be interrupted," replied Sparkle; "and there is yet
much to be said on the subject. I find there are many difficulties
to encounter in contending with the fashionable customs. Some learned
persons have endeavoured to support the practice of late dinners by
precedent, and quoted the Roman supper; but it ought to be recollected
that those suppers were at three o'clock in the afternoon, and should be
a subject of contempt, instead of imitation, in Grosvenor Square. Women,
<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>however, are not quite so irrational as men, in London, for they
generally sit down to a substantial lunch about three or four; if men
would do the same, the meal at eight might be relieved of many of its
weighty dishes, and conversation would be a gainer by it; for it must be
allowed on all hands, that conversation suffers great interruption from
the manner in which fashionable dinners are managed. First, the host and
hostess (or her unfortunate coadjutor) are employed during three parts
of the dinner in doing the work of servants, helping fish, or carving
venison to twenty hungry guests, to the total loss of the host's powers
of amusement, and the entire disfigurement of the fair hostess's face.
Again, much time is lost by the attention every one is obliged to
pay, in order to find out (which, by the way, he cannot do if he is
short-sighted) what dishes are at the extreme end of the table; and if
a guest is desirous of a glass of wine, he must peep through the Apollos
and Cupids of the plateau, in order to find some one to take it with;
otherwise he is compelled to wait till some one asks him, which will
probably happen in succession; so that after having had no wine for
half an hour, he will have to swallow five glasses in five minutes.
Convenience teaches, that the best manner of enjoying society at dinner,
is to leave every thing to the servants that servants can do; so that
no farther trouble may be experienced than to accept the dishes that
are presented, and to drink at your own time the wines which are
handed round. A fashionable dinner, on the contrary, seems to presume
beforehand on the silence, dulness, and insipidity of the guests, and
to have provided little interruptions, like the jerks which the Chaplain
gives to the Archbishop to prevent his going to sleep during a sermon."
</p>
<p>
"Accurate descriptions, as usual," said Tom, "and highly amusing."
</p>
<p>
Tallyho and Mortimer were intent upon hearing the remainder of Sparkle's
account, though they occasionally joined in the laugh, and observed that
Sparkle seemed to be in a very sentimental mood. As they continued to
walk on, he resumed&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Well then, some time after dinner comes the hour for the ball, or rout;
but this is sooner said than done: it often requires as much time to
go from St. James's Square to Cleveland Row, as to go from London to
Hounslow.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>It would require volumes to describe the disappointment which
occurs on arriving in the brilliant mob of a ball-room. Sometimes, as
it has been before said, a friend is seen squeezed like yourself, at
the other end of the room, without a possibility of your communicating,
except by signs; and as the whole arrangement of the society is
regulated by mechanical pressure, you may happen to be pushed
against those to whom you do not wish to speak, whether bores, slight
acquaintances, or determined enemies. Confined by the crowd, stifled by
the heat, dazzled by the light, all powers of intellect are obscured;
wit loses its point, and sagacity its observation; indeed, the limbs
are so crushed, and the tongue so parched, that, except particularly
undressed ladies, all are in the case of the traveller, Mr. Clarke,
when he says, that in the plains of Syria some might blame him for not
making moral reflections on the state of the country; but that he must
own that the heat quite deprived him of all power of thought. Hence it
is, that the conversation you hear around you is generally nothing more
than&mdash;"Have you been here long?&mdash;Have you been at Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;'s?&mdash;Are
you going to Lady D&mdash;&mdash;'s?"&mdash;Hence too,
</p>
<p>
Madam de Staël said very justly to an Englishman, "Dans vos routes le
corps fait plus de frai que l'esprit." But even if there are persons of
a constitution robust enough to talk, they dare not do so, when twenty
heads are forced into the compass of one square foot; nay, even if, to
your great delight, you see a person to whom you have much to say, and
by fair means or foul, elbows and toes, knees and shoulders, have got
near him, he often dismisses you with shaking you by the hand,
and saying&mdash;My dear Mr.&mdash;&mdash; how do you do? and then continues a
conversation with a person whose ear is three inches nearer. At one
o'clock, however, the crowd diminishes; and if you are not tired by the
five or six hours of playing at company, which you have already had, you
may be very comfortable for the rest of the evening. This however is
the round of fashionable company. But I begin to be tired even of the
description."
</p>
<p>
"A very luminous and comprehensive view of fashionable society however,"
said Tom, "sketched by a natural hand in glowing colours, though not
exactly in the usual style. I shall not venture to assert whether
the subjects are well chosen, but the figures are well grouped, and
<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>display considerable ability and lively imagination in the
painter, though a little confused."
</p>
<p>
"It appears to be a study from nature," said Mortimer.
</p>
<p>
"At least," continued Sparkle, "it is a study from Real Life, and
delineates the London manners; for although I have been a mingler in
the gaieties and varieties of a London Life, I have always held the
same opinions with respect to the propriety of the manners and customs
adopted, and have endeavoured to read as I ran; and it cannot be
denied, that, in the eye of fashion, nothing can be more amiable than to
deviate, or at least to affect a deviation, from nature, for to speak
or act according to her dictates, would be considered vulgar and
common-place in the last degree; to hear a story and not express an
emotion you do not feel, perfectly rude and unmannerly, and among the
ladies particularly. To move and think as the heart feels inclined,
are offences against politeness that no person can ever in honour or
delicacy forgive."
</p>
<p>
"Come, come," said Tom, "don't you be so hard on the blessings of Life&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "For who, that knows the thrilling touch
          Which Woman's love can give,
          Would wish to live for aught so much,
          As bid those beauties live?

          For what is life, which all so prize,
          And all who live approve,
          Without the fire of Woman's eyes,
          To bid man live and love?"
</pre>
<p>
Sparkle affected to laugh, appeared confused, and look'd down for a few
moments, and they walk'd on in silence.
</p>
<p>
"I perceive," said Tom, "how the matter stands&mdash;well, I shall not be a
tormentor&mdash;but remember I expect an introduction to the fair enslaver. I
thought you 'defy'd the mighty conqueror of hearts,' and resolved to be
free."
</p>
<p>
"Resolutions, as well as promises, are easily made," said Sparkle,
"but not always so easily accomplished or performed&mdash;nor are you always
accurate in your conceptions of circumstances; but no matter, your
voyages are always made in search of discoveries, and, in spite of your
resolutions, <span class="pagenum">[183]</span>you may perchance be entrapp'd. But no more of this;
I perceive your raillery is directed to me, and I hope you enjoy it."
</p>
<p>
"Faith," replied Tom, "you know I always enjoy your company, but I don't
recollect to have found you in so prosing a humour before&mdash;Pray, which
way are you directing your coursel?"
</p>
<p>
During the latter part of this conversation, Bob and young Mortimer were
employed in admiring the fine piece of water which presented itself to
their notice in the Serpentine River.
</p>
<p>
"Merely for a ride," was the reply; "any way you please, to pass away
the time."
</p>
<p>
"Mighty cavalier, truly," said Tom; "but come, here we are at
Kensington, let us mount, and away."
</p>
<p>
"Remember, I expect you and Mr. Tallyho to accompany me in the evening
to a family-party. I have already stated my intention, and you are both
expected."
</p>
<p>
"Upon these terms then, I am your man, and I think I may answer for my
Cousin."
</p>
<p>
By this time they were at the gate, where, finding the curricle and the
nags all in readiness, Sparkle and Mortimer were soon horsed, and Tom
and Bob seated in the curricle. They proceeded to Richmond, taking
surveys of the scenery on the road, and discoursing on the usual topics
of such a journey, which being foreign to the professed intention of
this work, are omitted. Suffice it to say they returned refreshed from
the excursion, and parted with a promise to meet again at nine o'clock,
in Grosvenor Square.
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" said Dashall, as they entered the diningroom, "there is
something very mysterious in all this. Sparkle has hitherto been the
life and soul of society: he seems to be deeply smitten with this young
Lady, Miss Mortimer, and promises fairly, by his manner, to prove a
deserter from our standard, and to inlist under the banners of Hymen."
</p>
<p>
"Not unlikely," replied Tallyho, "if what we are told be true&mdash;that it
is what we must all come to."
</p>
<p>
"Be that as it may, it ought not to interfere with our pursuits, Real
Life in London, though, to be sure, the Ladies, dear creatures, ought
not to be forgotten: they are so nearly and dearly interwoven with our
existence, that, without them, Life would be insupportable."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>After dinner, they prepared for the evening party, and made their
appearance in Grosvenor Squire at the appointed hour. But as this will
introduce new characters to the Reader, we shall defer our account of
them till the next Chapter.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XIV
</h2>
<pre>
          Ye are stars of the night, ye are gems of the morn,
          Ye are dew-drops whose lustre illumines the thorn;
          And rayless that night is, that morning unblest,
          When no beam in your eye, lights up peace in the breast;
          And the sharp thorn of sorrow sinks deep in the heart,
          Till the sweet lip of Woman assuages the smart;
          'Tis her's o'er the couch of misfortune to bend,
          In fondness a lover, in firmness a friend;
          And prosperity's hour, be it ever confest,
          From Woman receives both refinement and zest;
          And adorn'd by the bays, or enwreath'd with the willow,
          Her smile is our meed, and her bosom our pillow.
</pre>
<p>
ARRIVED at Grosvenor Square, they found the party consisted of Colonel
B&mdash;&mdash;, his son and daughter, Miss Mortimer, and her brother, Mr.
Sparkle, Mr. Merrywell, and Lady Lovelace. The first salutations of
introduction being over, there was time to observe the company, among
whom, Miss Mortimer appeared to be the principal magnet of attraction.
The old Colonel was proud to see the friends of Mr. Sparkle, and had
previously given a hearty welcome to Mr. Merrywell, as the friend of his
nephew, the young Mortimer. Sparkle now appeared the gayest of the gay,
and had been amusing the company with some of his liveliest descriptions
of character and manners, that are to be witnessed in the metropolis.
While Merrywell, who did not seem to be pleased with the particular
attentions he paid to Miss Mortimer, was in close conversation with her
brother.
</p>
<p>
Tom could not but acknowledge that it was scarcely possible to see Miss
Mortimer, without feelings of a nature which he had scarcely experienced
before. The elegant neatness of her dress was calculated to display the
beauty of her form, and the vivid flashes of a dark eye were so
many irresistible attacks upon the heart; a sweet voice, and smiling
countenance, appeared to throw a radiance around the room, and
illuminate the visages of the whole <span class="pagenum">[186]</span>party, while Lady Lovelace
and Maria B&mdash;&mdash; served as a contrast to heighten that effect which
they envied and reproved. While tea was preparing, after which it was
proposed to take a rubber at cards, a sort of general conversation took
place: the preparations for the Coronation, the new novels of the day,
and the amusements of the theatre, were canvassed in turn; and speaking
of the writings of Sir Walter Scott, as the presumed author of the
celebrated Scotch novels, Lady Lovelace declared she found it impossible
to procure the last published from the library, notwithstanding her name
has been long on the list, so much was it in request.
</p>
<p>
Sparkle replied, "That he had purchased the Novel, and would willingly
lend it to the Ladies. As for the Libraries," continued he, "they are
good places of accommodation, but it is impossible to please every one,
either there or any where else; they are however very amusing at times,
and as a proof of it, I strolled the other morning to a Circulating
Library, for the express purpose of lounging away an hour in digesting
the politics and news of the day; but the curious scenes to which I
was witness during this short period, so distracted my attention, that,
despite of the grave subjects on which I was meditating, I could not
resist lending an attentive ear to all that passed around me. There was
something of originality in the countenance of the Master of the Library
which struck me forcibly; and the whimsical answers which he made to his
numerous subscribers, and the yet more whimsical tone in which they
were pronounced, more than once provoked a smile. The first person
who attracted my notice was a fine showy looking woman, dressed in
the extreme of fashion, with a bloom upon her cheek, which might have
emulated that of the rose, with this exception, that it wanted the charm
of nature. Putting a list into the hands of the Bookseller, she
inquired if he had any of the productions the names of which were
there transcribed. Glancing his eye over the paper, he replied (with
an archness which not a little disconcerted her, and which probably
occasioned her abrupt disappearance, "<i>The Fine Lady</i>, Madam, is seldom
or ever at home; but <i>Family Secrets</i> we are always ready to let out."
'<i>Characters of Eminent Men</i>' growled out a little vulgar consequential
Citizen, whose countenance bore the stamp of that insufferable
dulness that might almost tempt <span class="pagenum">[187]</span>one to imagine him incapable of
comprehending the meaning of the words which he pronounced with an air
of so much self-importance; '<i>Characters of Eminent Men</i>, 195,' repeated
the Snarler, in the same tone, 'I much fear if we can boast a quarter
of that number, eh! Mr. Margin?' "I fear not, Sir," replied Margin;
"but such as we have are very much at your service." 'Better be in the
service of the nation than in mine, by far,' said the little purse-proud
gentleman, shrugging his shoulders very significantly. "Shall I send
it for you, Sir?" said Margin, without noticing the last remark. 'By no
means, by no means; the volume is not so large, it won't encumber me
much; I believe I shall find it small enough to put in my pocket,'
pursued the little great man, grinning at the shrewdness of his own
observations, and stalking out with as much self-complacency as he had
stalked in. I knew the man well, and could not help laughing at the
lofty airs he assumed, at the manner in which he affected to decry all
his countrymen without mercy, at his unwillingness to acknowledge
any talent amongst them, though he himself was a man of that plodding
description who neither ever had done, nor ever could do any thing to
entitle him to claim distinction of any sort. The young Coxcomb who next
entered, was a direct contrast to the last applicant, both in person and
manner. Approaching with a fashionable contortion, he stretched out his
lady-like hand, and in the most languid and affected tone imaginable,
inquired for The Idler. "That, Sir," said Margin, "is amongst the works
we have unhappily lost, but you will be sure to meet with it at any of
the fashionable libraries in the neighbourhood of Bond Street or St.
James's." The young Fop had just sense enough to perceive that the shaft
was aimed at him, but not enough to relish the joke, or correct the
follies which provoked it, and turned abruptly on his heel. He was met
at the door by a sentimental boarding-school Miss, who came flying into
the shop in defiance of her governess, and inquired, in a very pathetic
tone, for <i>The Constant Lover</i>. "That, I am afraid," said Margin, "is
not amongst our collection." 'Dear me,' lisped the young Lady, with an
air of chagrin, 'that's very provoking, I thought that was what every
one had.' "Give me leave to assure you, Ma'am, that you are quite
mistaken. I fancy you will find that it is not to be met with all over
London."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>An old Gentleman of the old school, whose clothes were decidedly
the cut of the last century, and whose stiff and formal manners were
precisely of the same date with his habiliments, next came hobbling
in. Poring through his spectacles over the catalogue which lay upon the
counter, the first thing which caught his eye, was <i>An Essay upon Old
Maids</i>. "Tom, Tom," said the complaisant Librarian, calling to a lad at
the other end of the shop, "reach down the Old Maids for the gentleman.
They won't appear to advantage, I'm afraid, a little dusty or damaged,
with having laid so long upon the shelf," he added, with a simper, which
was not lost upon any one present. A melancholy looking man, in whose
countenance meekness and insipidity were alike plainly depicted,
now came forward, inquiring, in an under, and what might almost be
designated an alarmed tone of voice, for <i>The Impertinent Wife</i>; a
female, who hung upon his arm, interrupted him by entreating, or rather
insisting in no very gentle tone, 'that he would ask for something
better worth having.' Margin, affecting only to hear the former speaker,
immediately produced the book in question, and observed, with much
naivete, "that the Impertinent Wife was sure to be in the way at all
hours," at the same time not omitting to recommend Discipline as "a
better work." A young man, whom I knew to be one of the greatest fortune
hunters about town, with an air of consummate assurance, put out
his hand for <i>Disinterested Marriage</i>. "That's a thing quite out of
date&mdash;never thought of now, Sir," said Margin, who knew him as well as
myself; "Allow me to recommend something of more recent date, something
more sought after in the fashionable world, Splendid Misery, Sir,
or&mdash;"The young man heard no more: spite of his impudence, he was so
abashed by the reply, that he made a hasty retreat. The last person whom
I thought it worth my while to notice, was a tall, meagre looking man,
whom I recollected to have seen pointed out to me as a wit, and a genius
of the first order. His wit was, however, of that dangerous sort which
caused his company to be rather shunned than courted; and it was very
evident, from his appearance, that he had not had the wit to work
himself into the good graces of those who might have had it in their
power to befriend him. Though he spoke in a very low tone, I soon
found that he was inquiring for <i>Plain Sense</i>. On Margin's replying,
<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>with much nonchalance, that <i>Plain Sense</i> had of late become very
rare, finding himself disappointed in his first application, his next
aim was <i>Patronage</i>. "That, Sir, (said the wary bookseller) is so much
sought after, that I really cannot promise it to you at present; but if,
as I conclude, you merely want something to beguile a leisure hour or
two, probably <i>The Discontented Man</i> will answer the purpose very well."
</p>
<p>
To this description of Sparkle, the whole company listened with
attention and delight, frequently interrupting him with bursts of
laughter. Tea was handed round, and then cards introduced. Young
Mortimer and Merrywell seemed to take but little interest in the play,
and evidently discovered their anxiety to be liberated, having some
other object in view. Mortimer felt no great portion of pleasure in
passing his time with his uncle, the Colonel, nor with his sister, Lady
Lovelace, who was a perfect model of London affectation; besides, his
friend Mr. Merrywell, who was to him what Tom Dashall and Sparkle had
been to Tallyho, had made an engagement to introduce him to some of
his dashing acquaintances in the West. Nods and winks were interchanged
between them, and could not but be noticed by Tom and Bob, though
Sparkle was so intent upon the amusements of the moment, and the company
of the lovely Caroline, as to appear immoveable.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Merrywell at length stated that he must be compelled to quit the
party. Young Mortimer also apologized; for as he and his friend were
engaged for an early excursion in the morning, he should take a bed at
his habitation, in order to be fully prepared. This was the first step
to breaking up the party.
</p>
<p>
Merrywell called Sparkle on one side, saying he had something of
importance to communicate. It was twelve o'clock, and the gentlemen,
after taking a formal leave of the ladies and the Colonel, and a promise
on the part of Sparkle to meet them again the next morning at twelve, to
escort them to the Exhibition, left the house.
</p>
<p>
"I am really happy," said Merrywell to Sparkle as they passed the
door, "to have had the honour of this introduction, and shall have much
pleasure in becoming better acquainted with Mr. Sparkle, who, though
personally unknown to me, his name and fame are familiar.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>Mr. Mortimer and myself are going to take a review of the
neighbourhood of St. James's, probably to shake an elbow."
</p>
<p>
"Excellent," said Tom; "here is a fine opportunity for Mr. Tallyho to
take a like survey, and, if agreeable, we will join the party. Though
I am by no means a friend to gaming, I conceive it necessary that every
person should see the haunts of its votaries, and the arts they make use
of, in order to avoid them."
</p>
<p>
"You are right, and therefore let us have a peep at them." With this
they 'walk'd on, listening with attention to the following lines, which
were recited by Sparkle:
</p>
<pre>
          "Behold yon group, fast fix'd at break of day,
          Whose haggard looks a sleepless night betray,
          With stern attention, silent and profound,
          The mystic table closely they surround;
          Their eager eyes with eager motions join,
          As men who meditate some vast design:
          Sure, these are Statesmen, met for public good,
          For some among them boast of noble blood:
          Or are they traitors, holding close debate
          On desp'rate means to overthrow the State?
          For there are men among them whose domains
          And goods and chattels lie within their brains.
          No, these are students of the blackest art
          That can corrupt the morals or the heart;
          Yet are they oft in fashion's ranks preferred,
          And men of honour, if you take their word.
          But they can plunder, pillage, and devour,
          More than poor robbers, at the midnight hour;
          Lay deeper schemes to manage lucky hits,
          Than artful swindlers, living by their wits.
          Like cunning fowlers, spread th' alluring snare,
          And glory when they pluck a pigeon bare.
          These are our gamesters, who have basely made
          The cards and dice their study and their trade."{1}

     1 Gaming is generally understood to have been invented by
     the Lydians, when they were under the pressure of a great
     famine. To divert themselves from dwelling on their
     sufferings, they contrived the balls, tables, &amp;c. and, in
     order to bear their calamity the better, were accustomed to
     play for the whole day together, without interruption, that
     they might not be rack'd with the thought of food, which
     they could not obtain. It is not a little extraordinary that
     this invention, which was originally intended as a remedy
     for hunger, is now a very common cause of that very evil.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>"True," said Merry well, as Sparkle concluded, though he did not
like the satire upon his own favourite pursuit; "those delineations are
correct, and the versification good, as far as it applies to the worst
species of the gaminghouse."
</p>
<p>
"O," said Tom, "then pray, Sir, which is the worst?"
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense," said Sparkle, "there is neither worse nor best; these Hells
are all alike. <i>Sharks, Greeks, Gamblers, Knowing Ones, Black-legs, and
Levanters</i>, are to be met with at them all, and <i>they meet to bite one
another's heads off</i>."
</p>
<p>
"An admirable description, truly, of the company you are about to
introduce us to, Gentlemen," said Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"I don't understand Greeks, Hells, and Black-legs," said Mortimer, "and
should like an explanation."
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart," replied Sparkle&mdash;"<i>Hell</i> is the general title now
given to any well-known gaming-house, and really appears to be well
chosen; for all the miseries that can fall to the lot of human nature,
are to be found in those receptacles of idleness, duplicity, and
villany. Gaming is an estate to which all the world has a pretence,
though few espouse it who are willing to secure either their estates
or reputations: and these Hells may fairly be considered as so many
half-way houses to the Fleet or King's Bench Prisons, or some more
desperate end. The love of play is the most incurable of insanities:
robbery, suicide, and the extensive ruin of whole families, have been
known to proceed from this unfortunate and fatal propensity.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Greeks, Gamblers, Knowing Ones, and Black-legs</i>, are synonimous terms,
applied to the frequenters of the modern Hells, or Gaming-houses,
and may be distinguished from the rest of society by the following
peculiarities in pursuits and manners.
</p>
<p>
"The <i>Greeks</i> of the present day, though they may not lay claim to, or
boast of all the attributes of the <i>Greeks</i> of antiquity, must certainly
be allowed to possess that quality for which the latter were ever so
celebrated, namely, <i>cunning and wariness</i>: for although no modern Greek
can be said to have any resemblance to Achilles, Ajax, Patroclus, or
Nestor, in point of courage, strength, fidelity, or wisdom, he may
nevertheless boast of being a close copier of the equally renowned
chief of Ithaca. You will find him in most societies, habited like a
gentleman; <span class="pagenum">[192]</span>his clothes are of the newest fashion, and his manners
of the highest polish, with every appearance of candour and honour;
while he subsists by unfair play at dice, cards, and billiards,
deceiving and defrauding all those with whom he may engage; disregarding
the professions of friendship and intimacy, which are continually
falling from his lips.
</p>
<p>
"To become a good <i>Greek</i> (which, by the way, is a contradiction) it
will be found necessary to follow these instructions:
</p>
<p>
"In the first place, lie should be able to command his temper; he should
speak but little, and when he does mingle in conversation, he should
most decidedly deprecate play, as a source of the greatest evil that
can prey upon society, and elucidate its tendencies by striking examples
which are well known to himself, and which are so forcibly impressed
upon his recollection, that he is determined never to play deep again,
but has no objection to a sociable and friendly game now and then, just
to pass the time away a little agreeably. By this means he may readily
mark down his man, and the game once in view, he should not appear too
eager in the pursuit of it, but take good care, as the proverb says,
to give a sprat, in order to catch a herring. This should be done by
allowing some temporary success, before he make a final hit.
</p>
<p>
"There is perhaps no art which requires so much of continual practice as
that of <i>Greekery</i>. It is therefore necessary, that the professor should
frequently exercise himself in private with cards and dice, in order
that his digits may be trained to a proper degree of agility, upon which
the success of his art principally depends. He should also be accustomed
to work with some younger man than himself, who, having once been
a pigeon, is become a naute, that is enlightened and will not
peach&mdash;consequently, he serves as an excellent decoy to others.
</p>
<p>
"To ascertain the property of the pigeon he intends to pluck, is another
essential requisite; and when this important information is obtained,
(which should be before he commences operations) he should affect the
utmost liberality as to time, &amp;c. and make a show of extending every
honourable facility to his opponent, even by offers of pecuniary
assistance; by which means, (if he should be fortunate enough to have
it accepted) he may probably, by good management, obtain a legal
<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>security from him, and thus be enabled to fasten on his prey
whenever he pleases.

"The title of a military man, such as Captain, is very useful to the
Greek, as it introduces him well to society, and if he has once held a
commission in the army, so much the better. If not, it can be assumed,
so that if any unpleasant regimental peculation should be introduced,
he may place his hand on the left side of his breast, declare he is
astonished and alarmed at the calumnious spirit of the times, shake his
head, and interlard his conversation with common-place ejaculations;
such as the following&mdash;Indeed&mdash;No&mdash;Why I know Harry very well&mdash;he's a
bit of a blood&mdash;can it be possible&mdash;I should not have thought it&mdash;bless
my heart&mdash;exactly so&mdash;good God&mdash;a devilish good joke tho'&mdash;that's very
true, says I&mdash;so says he, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
"A Greek should be a man of some personal courage, never shrink from
a row, nor be afraid to' fight a duel. He should be able to bully,
bluster, swagger and swear, as occasion may require; nay, in desperate
cases, such us peaching, &amp;c. he should not object even to assassination.
He should invite large parties to dine with him frequently, and have a
particular sort of wine for particular companies. He should likewise be
able to swallow a tolerable quantity of the juice of the grape himself,
as well as know how to appear as if he were drinking, when he is merely
passing the bottle, and so manage it passing, as to seem drunk at proper
times. When good opportunities present themselves for the exercise
of his art, and when a hit is really to be made, he should positively
refuse to suffer play of any kind in his house, alleging that he has
seen enough of it, and cut the concern. This serves to increase the
desire for it in others. On any decisive occasion, when a train is known
to be well laid, he should appear to be drunk before any one of the
party; in which case he should take care beforehand to instruct his
decoy to pluck the pigeon, while he, as a supposed observer, is betting
with some one in the company, (of course an accomplice) and is also a
loser.
</p>
<p>
"Greeks, who know each other, are enabled to convey information by means
of private signals, without uttering a word, and consequently without
detection. At whist, or other games on the cards, fingers are admirable
conveyancers of intelligence, and by dexterous performers <span class="pagenum">[194]</span>are
so managed, as to defy the closest scrutiny, so as to have the natural
appearance of pliancy, while, among the <i>knowing ones</i>, their movements
are actually deciding the fate of a rubber."
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" said Mortimer, "you seem to understand the business so well, I
wonder you don't open shop."
</p>
<p>
"My knowledge," continued Sparkle, "is but theoretical. I cannot boast
of much practical information, for it is long since I shook the lucky
castor."
</p>
<p>
"O, then, you are discontented because you have no luck."
</p>
<p>
"Not so," said Sparkle, "for I never play very deep, so that, win or
lose, I can never suffer much; but I am willing to give information to
others, and with that view I have detailed the nature of the houses
and the general character of their frequenters, according to my own
conception of them. The <i>Levanter</i> is a <i>Black-leg</i>, who lives by the
<i>broads</i>{l} and the <i>turf</i>,{2} and is accustomed to work as it were by
<i>telegraph</i>{3} with his pal; and if you take the broads in hand in their
company, you are sure to be work'd, either by glazing, that is, putting
you in the front of a looking-glass, by which means your hand is
discovered by your antagonist, or by private signals from the pal. On
the turf he will pick up some nobleman or gentleman, who he knows is
not <i>up to the rig</i>&mdash;bet him fifty or a hundred on a horse&mdash;pull out his
pocket-book&mdash;set down the name, and promise to be at the stand when
the race is over; but takes care to be seen no more, unless he is
the winner, which he easily ascertains by the direction his pal takes
immediately on the arrival of the horses. But hold, we must dismiss the
present subject of contemplation, for here we are at the very scene of
action, and now for ocular demonstration."

No. 40, now 32, Pall Mall, was the place of destination, a house well
known, said, in Koubel's time, to be more <i>à la Française</i>, and of
course more of a gambling-house, than any other of the same description
in London. The former were good judges of their business, and did things
in prime order; but, if report say true, the new Establishment

wholly by aliens&mdash;by Frenchmen!!! who are said to have realized 80,000L.

name is not Dormouse, has serious reason to remember that he has been a
visitor.
</p>
<pre>
These concerns are considered of so much importance, and are found to be
so very productive, that regular co-partnerships are entered into,
the business is conducted almost with the precision of a mercantile
establishment; all kinds of characters embark in these speculations, and
rapid fortunes are to be made by them; this alone ought to deter young
men from play, since it sufficiently indicates how much the chances are
in favour of the tables. But many high and noble names resort to them.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>Tallyho had already heard so much about Hells, Gambling-houses,
and Subscription-houses, that he was all anxiety for an interior view,
and the same feeling animated Mortimer. As they were about to enter,
they were not a little surprised to find that houses which are spoken of
so publicly, have in general the appearance of private dwellings, with
the exception that the hall-door is left ajar during the hours usually
devoted to play, like those of trap-cages, to catch the passing pigeons,
and to obviate the delay which might be occasioned by the necessity of
knocking&mdash;a delay which might expose the customers to the glances of an
unsuspecting creditor&mdash;a confiding father, or a starving wife; and, as
Merrywell observed, "It was to be understood that the entrance was well
guarded, and that no gentleman could be permitted to risk or lose his
money, without an introduction." A very necessary precaution to obviate
the danger of being surprised by the officers of the law; but that rule
is too easily to be broken, for any gentleman whom the door-keeper
has sufficient reason to think is not an Officer of Justice, finds the
avenues to these labyrinths too ready for his admission.

<p>
On passing the outer-door, they found themselves impeded by a second,
and a third, and each door constructed with a small spy-hole, exhibiting
the ball of a ruffian's eye, intently gazing on and examining their
figures. It is necessary to observe, that if the visitor is known to
be a fair pigeon, or an old crow, he is at once admitted by these
gentlemen, and politely bowed up stairs; and as Merrywell appeared to be
well known, no obstruction was offered, and they proceeded through the
last, which was an iron door, and were shewn directly into the room,
which presented a scene of dazzling astonishment.
</p>
<p>
On entering, they discovered the votaries of gaming around an oblong
table, covered with green cloth, and the priests of the ceremony in the
centre, one to deal cards and decide events, and another to assist him
in collecting the plunder which should follow such decisions. Being
engaged in the play, but little notice was taken of the arrival of the
party, except by two or three eagle-eyed gentlemen, who, perceiving
there were some <i>New-comes</i>{1}
</p>

     the usual visitants.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>and always keeping business in view, made up to Merrywell, began
to be very talkative&mdash;was happy to see him&mdash;hoped he had been well&mdash;and
congratulated him on the introduction of his friends&mdash;took snuff, and
handed the box round with all the appearance of unaffected friendship.
</p>
<p>
"These," said Tom Dashall to his Cousin, drawing him on one side, "are
the Proprietors{1} of this concern;
</p>
<pre>
     1 In order that the class of men by whom houses of this
     description are generally kept, and to shew the certainty
     they have of accumulating riches, as well as to guard the
     young and inexperienced against being decoyed, it may not be
     amiss to animadvert upon a few of the most prominent and
     well known.

     No. 7, Pall Mall, is kept by B&mdash;&mdash;l, who has been a public
     and noted gambler for these forty years, and is generally
     termed the Father of the Houses. He was at one time a poor
     man, but now, by his honest earnings, is in possession of
     some tens of thousands. It is said that he was originally a
     stable-boy, and, in process of time, arose to be a jobber in
     horse-flesh, but has at length feathered his nest with
     <i>pigeons down</i>.

     No. 77, St. James's Street, nick-named the Two Sevens, kept
     by Messrs. T. C. C. T. is a well-known House, where things
     are conducted with great civility and attention, and the
     best possible treatment may generally be relied upon, though
     they are rather sparing of refreshments, and apt to grumble
     if a customer has a run of good luck. A Prussian Officer,
     however, not long ago, kick'd up a devil of a row about
     losing a very large sum of money; but it is scarcely
     necessary to add it was all in vain, for there was no
     redress.

     The produce of this Bank, (which Paddy B&mdash;&mdash; calls the
     Devil's Exchequer, whence you can draw neither principal nor
     interest,) furnishes elegant houses and equipages, both in
     town and country, and, it is possible, may one day or other
     send a Member to Parliament, or a General to the field.

     No. 10, King Street, St. James's, is conducted by old and
     young D&mdash;&mdash;s L&mdash;&mdash;r; the father is too old in iniquity
     to remember his progress from poverty to affluence.

     No. 5, King-street, is kept by Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;l; the former
     residing at No. 3, Leicester-place, the latter No. 3,&mdash;&mdash;
     Street; and both live in prime style. The former, in his
     youth, was an errand boy, and he became so willing in doing
     little jobs, that his employers have paid him most
     handsomely. The latter gentleman, who may be seen frequently
     driving a dennet, and looking both sides of the road at
     once, is a chip of the old block: but as it is not our
     intention to visit the sins of the sou upon the father, we
     shall not enter into a minute examination of him.

     No. 6, in Bury-street, is only about a year's standing.
     This table was set up by a broken adventurer, Capt. B&mdash;&mdash;,
     with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, a jeweller, and a man whose agents keep a
     house of ill fame, no way inferior in attribute  to his
     house in Bury-street.    They commenced with narrow funds,
     and now, thank the gulls, are independent.

     The next door, No. 7, is held by M&mdash;&mdash;g, a map-seller,
     living at Charing Cross; Carl&mdash;s, formerly an under-
     strapper at Ben&mdash;t's, living at King's Road, Chelsea; H&mdash;&mdash;ll,
     a tallow-chandler, living at No. 8, Bury-street; and
     his brother, a brick-layer, residing somewhere off Grosvenor
     Place. These fellows have carried on their depredations for
     some time, but now have closed for awhile, being one of the
     houses against whom a Jew, named Portugal John, and another
     named the Young Black Diamond, have commenced proceedings,
     for sums had and received, and by indictment.

     No.  28, in the same street, is the property  of one O&mdash;&mdash;
     d, formerly a menial servant, and not long ago a porter to
     B&mdash;&mdash;l.

     These examples shew by incontestible inference, that the
     keepers of those tables have an advantage, which renders
     their success certain, while it fleeces the men who attend
     them. We always have seen these Proprietors in the same
     unchangeable affluence, driving their equipages, keeping
     their country houses, &amp;c. &amp;c. while those who play
     invariably sink into poverty. It has been often&mdash;very often
     remarked, that young men who commence this career of folly
     and vice, by degrees lose that freshness and fashionable
     appearance which they at first possessed, and at last are
     seen wandering about St. James's Park <i>counting the trees</i>,
     and dining on a <i>gravel hash</i>, for want of more genial fare,
     in a threadbare coat, half-polished boots, a greasy hat, and
     a dirty cravat; while the plunderers of their happiness and
     property are driving by them in luxury, enjoying their
     pleasure by contrast with their victim, and sneering at his
     miseries.

     Of all the vices which deform this Metropolis (and there are
     not a few) the most ruinous is that of Rouge et Noir
     gambling, for that is practised in the day time, and it is a
     matter of astonishment to think that it has remained
     undisturbed by the law, and hitherto unnoticed by the Press.
     At this moment no less than twelve of these Hells are open
     to the public in the noon-day; and no less than five or six
     profane the Sabbath by their sinful practices. Although
     London has been, time out of mind, infested with the imps of
     play, yet it was not until within these last ten or fifteen
     years that they dared open their dens to the honest light of
     day. About that period, or a very short time before, Rouge
     et Noir was imported, amongst other fashionable things, from
     France; and to this game we are indebted for the practice of
     gambling in the day-light.

     It is impossible to put down the vice of Gaming wholly, and
     not all the various enactments of the legislature against it
     have succeeded; but that the ruinous and infamous practice
     of indulging that vice in the midst of crowded day should be
     suffered, for upwards of sixteen years, in the centre of
     British society, when it can easily be suppressed, calls
     forth our wonder, and gives a stronger proof to us that our
     Societies for the Suppression of Vice, &amp;c. &amp;c. are shadows
     with a name. When the Hazard tables open, it is at an hour
     when the respectable and controlled youths of London are
     within the walls of their homes; few are abroad except the
     modern man of <i>ton</i>, the rake, the sot, the robber, and the
     vagabond; and the dangers of gaming on these orders of
     society is little indeed, when compared with the baneful
     effects of that vice upon the mercantile youth of London. It
     is to this class, and to the youth of the middling orders of
     society, that gaming is destructive, and it is upon these
     that the Rouge et Noir tables cast the most fatal influence.
     Young men of this order cannot in general be absent from
     their families after midnight, the hour when the nocturnal
     Hells formerly yawned upon their victims; but now the
     introduction of Rouge et Noir has rendered the abominable
     track of play a morning and evening's lounge, set forth in
     all the false glare which the artful proprietors can invent
     to deceive the thoughtless; and thus it affords
     opportunities and temptations to such youth almost
     irresistible.

     When the glittering of London pleasures first meets the eye
     of a young man placed upon the road of a mercantile life, or
     when he enters any of the multifarious departments in the
     machine of society which always lead the industrious and
     prudent to honourable emolument, he too frequently
     misconceives the fashionable gamester's character, and
     confounds his crimes with elegant accomplishments. The road
     to pleasure is broad, and the gates of these Hells are open
     to him at hours when he can be absent, and can indulge his
     whim without suspicion&mdash;for at first he looks upon his new
     enjoyment but a mere whim, which he can abandon at any
     moment. But how different is the proof! He goes on&mdash;his new
     made wings carry him through a region of delight, and he
     believes himself to possess the powers of the eagle&mdash;still
     lighter he ascends, and the solid earth on which he formerly
     trod in safety, recedes immeasurably from his giddy eye&mdash;at
     length his wings prove wax, they melt before the sun, and
     the victim of his own folly tumbles into the abyss of
     destruction.

     It is no uncommon thing, nay, we will positively declare it
     to be a very frequent practice of these misled young men,
     when they have been initiated, and have the temporary
     command of money belonging to their employers, to go to the
     Rouge et Noir tables, armed (as they think) with
     impenetrable armour&mdash;a large sum; and, in the hope of
     profiting to a certain amount, risk that property, the loss
     of which would be the loss of every thing dear to them in
     society. They believe, from the greatness of the amount they
     possess, that they can command a small gain, and not for a
     moment doubt they will be able to replace or return the
     money entrusted to their care; but little do they know the
     fickleness of luck, and less do they suspect the odds and
     imposing roguery arrayed against them. Their first loss is
     trifling, but they have to win that back iu addition to
     their expected profits; for this purpose they stake a larger
     sum, which, if they lose, increases their task, and so on,
     until the half-frantic victims see no hope but desperation,
     and their remaining stock is placed upon the chance of a
     single card. The event closes, and the man who yesterday
     enjoyed the good opinion of the world, and the esteem and
     confidence of his friends, to-day becomes the veriest
     outcast of society! These are common cases, one of which,
     for example, we will describe as the facts occurred:&mdash;In the
     year 1816, a Clerk, possessing the highest reputation,
     became a frequenter of a Rouge et Noir table. From the
     nature of his employment, he had daily the command of large
     sums, which, for a short time, he risked at play
     successfully. One day, however, he brought with him his
     employer's money, to the amount of 1700L. the whole of
     which, in two days, he lost. We may judge of the unhappy
     young man's feelings by his subsequent conduct. He wrote a
     confession of the affair to the man he wronged, retired to a
     tavern, and blew his brains out!

     These gaming-tables open at half-past twelve o'clock,
     continue their orgies until five, and recommence at seven in
     the evening. How many young men are passing their doors at
     these hours with the property of others in their pockets!&mdash;
     and what a temptation to risk it! It would seem as if these
     places were set up as shops designed chiefly for the
     accommodation of mid-day dealers in ill-fortune, as if
     levelled directly at those men who cannot or will not spend
     their nights in gambling; and how the proprietors contrive
     to escape detection and punishment is surprising,
     considering that the law affords ample means to put them
     down.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>they know their customers, and place themselves here to watch the
progress of their gains. Their attentions are always directed to the
new-comers. Remorseless, avaricious, and happy&mdash;unmarked with the lines
of care, which contract and deform the faces of their victims, "They
smile and smile, and murder while they smile." They will explain
the fairness of the game, and tell you of the great losses they have
sustained; but as this is no place for explanation, we must look on and
say nothing."
</p>
<p>
By this time, Merrywell and Mortimer were mingled in the throng at the
table. Sparkle was engaged in conversation with an old acquaintance, a
profusion of money was flying about, and a large heap or bank was placed
in the centre. All was anxiety, and, for a few moments, no sound was
heard, but the awful numbers of the eventful dealer; every countenance
was hushed in expectation, and every eye was fixed upon the coming card,
which should decide the fate of hundreds. It was an awful moment to
every one engaged in the play; but the pause was succeeded with a sort
of harlequinade movement, to a scene of confusion and uproar scarcely to
be conceived.
</p>
<p>
The appearance at the door of half a dozen persons armed with pistols,
rushing past the guardians, and bearing <span class="pagenum">[201]</span>away all before them, had
such an instantaneous effect upon the company, that they all arose,
as it were, to receive them, and the leader of the party threw himself
suddenly upon the pile of Bank-notes in the centre of the table, with
intent to seize the whole bank.
</p>
<p>
Confusion and dismay were now visibly depicted on every countenance, for
some, actuated by desperation at the prospect of ruin, and others by the
urgings of avarice, determined to have a scramble for the notes, which
they commenced most furiously, each one securing as much as he could to
himself. There was tumbling and tossing, and pulling and shoving, mouths
stuffed with hundreds, hundreds of mouths that were supperless, and
likely to continue so, unless they could now make sure of something.
Bank paper was literally going for nothing. However, the pistols being
the most powerful, the armed forces succeeded in seizing the greatest
share of the stock, and a negative sort of silence was at length
restored. The party was materially decreased; for, seeing they were
betrayed, every one, after an endeavour to secure a share of the spoil,
deemed it necessary to make good his retreat; and among the rest,
our party, who had not interfered with the play, or assisted in the
entertainment, soon found themselves in the street.
</p>
<p>
"Egad," said Sparkle, "I think we are in luck to escape so easily;
we might have been compelled to make our appearance at Bow Street
to-morrow, an occurrence I would studiously avoid."
</p>
<p>
"Well done, old steady," said Tom; "it is not long, you know, since you
was there, after a night's lodging in the neighbourhood."
</p>
<p>
"That was under very different circumstances," continued Sparkle; "in
defence of a woman I would risk my life at any time, but I would by
no means incur the imputation of being a gambler&mdash;it is a character I
abhor. I have before said I would never venture into those dens again,
to herd with swindlers of all descriptions."
</p>
<p>
"They all seem gay fellows, too," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied Sparkle; "but the character and conduct of a young man
has ere now been altered in one night: the evil effects produced by
initiation to those Hells are incalculable."
</p>
<p>
"Moralizing at midnight," said Tom; "an excellent title for a volume
<i>sparkling</i> contemplations."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>"To be written by the Hon. Tom Dashall, or the Merry Devil of
Piccadilly," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
"Huzza!" said Merrywell, "if this is the case, our time will not be lost
in this excursion. Did you hear that Lord &mdash;&mdash; has been compelled to put
down his establishment in consequence of his losses at play? pray don't
forget to mention that in the work."
</p>
<p>
"Tis no new thing," continued Sparkle, "for Lords of the present day,
since I believe there are few of the nobility who are not either Greeks
or Pigeons; indeed, the list of visitors to these places contains names
of many persons who should set better examples to the humbler classes of
the community; for the unfortunate results of this too fatal propensity
to parents and society have been severely felt. Among many instances
on record, a very interesting one is related of a young Subaltern in a
regiment of cavalry, who, by successive losses, was reduced to such a
state of distress, as to form the desperate resolution of trying the
road. In a moment of agony, he accidentally met with an opportunity
which seemed to favour his design, having learned that a certain
Baronet, recently returned from India with abundance of wealth, had laid
it out on landed estates in England, and that he would on a certain day
cross the country with a large sum of money, after collecting his rents.
</p>
<p>
"He laid his plan for a meeting on a retired spot, and succeeded in
stopping the carriage&mdash;' Your money or your life,' said he, presenting
his pistol with a trembling hand. The Baronet, perceiving there was a
sort of gentlemanly air about him which indicated something more than
might be calculated on in the character of a highwayman, presented him
with his purse, a watch, and a valuable diamond ring, remarking, he
could not help conceiving that he was unaccustomed to the trade, and
that it was most desirable he should abandon it for ever. The
young Officer, though considerably confused and embarrassed by this
observation, was not to be disappointed of his booty, returned this
property, and demanded the larger sum, which for safety had been
concealed in the bottom of the carriage. The manner however in which
this was done, only served to confirm the suspicions of the Baronet,
which he could not help expressing, as he acknowledged the accuracy of
the Highwayman's information, and produced the property, observing, he
was sure that <span class="pagenum">[203]</span>circumstances of no common kind could have impelled
him to this flagrant breach of the laws. He asked as a favour, that he
would grant him an interview at some future period, pledging his honour
that he should have no occasion to repent such a singular mark of
confidence.
</p>
<p>
"The Officer replied that he had, and he felt he could with safety
trust both his life and his honour in the veracity of Sir &mdash;&mdash;, and
appointed a meeting at the London Coffee House, Ludgate Hill, only
stipulating, that at such meeting both parties were to be unattended.
As the day of meeting approached, the Baronet thought seriously of the
solicited rencontre, and after enjoining perfect secresy on the part of
his friend, Col. &mdash;&mdash;, entreated him to be his companion. The Colonel
laughed at the idea, that any man who had robbed another should so
indiscreetly place his life in his hands, had no conception of his
keeping his appointment, and solemnly assured the Baronet that he would
in no case divulge who or what he was, that he might become acquainted
with.
</p>
<p>
"The Colonel ridiculed his friend's credulity as they entered the house,
and were shewn to a private room. The appointed hour was eight in the
evening, and, as the clock of St. Paul's struck, a Gentleman inquiring
for Sir &mdash;&mdash; was shewn into the room&mdash;wine was ordered, and for an hour
a general conversation on the popular topics of the day ensued, when the
Gentleman, evidently under deeply impressed feelings of embarrassment
and disappointment, in which the Colonel seemed to partake, arose, and
politely took his leave.
</p>
<p>
"' Well,' said the Baronet, 'what think you of my Highwayman now 1&mdash;am I
not right?&mdash;is he not a gentleman?'
</p>
<p>
"' And this is the robber, is it, Sir?' said the Colonel&mdash;'Be assured
he shall swing for it&mdash;why, Sir, I know him well, he is a &mdash;&mdash; in my own
regiment.'
</p>
<p>
"'Hold,' said the Baronet, 'don't be rash, remember the solemn promise
you have given, and do not deceive me&mdash;I hold you bound to me, and will
not permit you to break your engagement&mdash;I have better objects in view
than the death of a fellow-creature.'
</p>
<p>
"He then requested to be informed of the general tenor of the young
man's conduct, which he found to be excellent, and that he was an
indefatigable officer&mdash;'Indeed,' said the Colonel, 'it would give me the
greatest <span class="pagenum">[204]</span>pain to lose him&mdash;an incomparably affectionate husband
and father. He has but one vice, to which may be attributed his
destruction, viz. his inordinate passion for gaming; but I cannot feel
justified in screening so flagrant an offender&mdash;the law must take its
course.'
</p>
<p>
"'Moderate your indignation,' said the worthy Baronet, assuming a more
serious tone, 'and remember you must be personalty answerable to me for
any disclosure you may think proper to make; and that inasmuch as you
injure him, you must injure me. You have already given him so high a
character in every respect but one, that I must interest you further
in his behalf, and beg you to assist me in my endeavours to reclaim,
instead of punishing him.'
</p>
<p>
"The Colonel was surprised; but the Baronet was inflexible. In vain
he urged that the magnitude of the crime utterly precluded such a
proceeding.
</p>
<p>
"' It must be done,' said the Baronet, 'it shall be done. Leave all the
consequences to me; he has now left us in extreme, though suppressed
agitation&mdash;There is no time to lose&mdash;fly to save him.'
</p>
<p>
"The Colonel expressed his readiness to try the experiment.
</p>
<p>
"' Then,' said the Baronet, 'follow him immediately, assure him of
my forgiveness, and that if he will pledge his word to forsake this
dangerous vice, what he has already obtained he may hold as a gift, and
I will add whatever may be necessary to extricate him from any temporary
embarrassment.'
</p>
<p>
"It was an important embassy&mdash;life or death was to be decided by it. The
Colonel took his departure, certain of finding him at home taking leave
of his family, and, reaching his habitation a short time after his
arrival, witnessed a scene of misery which, although he had partly
anticipated, he could not have conceived. He found him, surrounded by
his wife and children, in an agony of desperation and despair.
</p>
<p>
"When he entered the apartment, the poor culprit, convinced by the
presence of his Colonel that all was lost, fell on his knees, and
supplicated if possible that his fame, not his life, might be spared for
the sake of his afflicted but innocent and injured family. Language has
no power to describe the surprise and consternation with which, after a
severe lecture, he received the joyful intelligence of <span class="pagenum">[205]</span>which
his Colonel was the bearer. He returned with his Commanding Officer
to &mdash;&mdash; Square, where he was received by the Baronet as a repentant
friend; and has lived to repair his error, and become deservedly
distinguished as an ornament to society, civil and religious as well as
military."
</p>
<p>
"That must be truly gratifying to the worthy Baronet,{1}' said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"No doubt of it," continued Sparkle, "it must be a source of continued
pleasure to find his labours have had so beneficial a result, having in
all probability saved a whole family from destruction. Surely it may be
said, that
</p>
<pre>
          "Among the idiot pranks of Wealth's abuse,
          None seem so monstrous, none have less excuse,
          Than those which throw an heritage away
          Upon the lawless chance of desperate play;
          Nor is there among knaves a wretch more base
          Than he who steals it with a smiling face,
          Who makes diversion to destruction tend,
          And thrives upon the ruin of a friend."
</pre>
<p>
&mdash;"Yet the Greek, like the swindler{l} and the horse jockey,
</p>
<pre>
     1 Swindler&mdash;Is a term originally derived from the German,
     Schwindel, which signifies merely to cheat. It was first
     introduced as a cant term, and used to signify obtaining of
     goods, credit, or money, under false pretences. It has since
     had a legislative adoption, being parliamentary recognised
     by an Act for the prevention of it. The artifices, schemes,
     and crimes, resorted to by these gentry, are so numerous,
     that it would be impossible to describe them all. One mode
     of practice, however, is not uncommon in London.

     Three or four swell Jews contrive to hire a large house with
     some spare rooms, in the City, that are turned into
     warehouses, in which are a number of casks, boxes, &amp;e.
     filled with sand; and also a quantity of large sugar-loaves
     in appearance, which are only clay done up in blue paper,
     but corded and made up with great nicety.

     An elegant Counting-house is likewise furnished with books
     and other apparatus, to deceive the eye and give the
     appearance of extensive business, great regularity, and
     large property. The Clerks in attendance are a set of Jews,
     who are privy to the scheme, and equally ready at fraud as
     those who profess to be the Principals.

     A Dining-room elegantly furnished upon the <i>mace</i>,* receives
     you

          * The Mace&mdash;Is a person who carries all the appearance of a
          great and rich man, with servants, carriages, &amp;c. for the
          purpose of defrauding tradesmen and others, by all manner of
          plans most calculated to entrap the parties they intend to
          dupe.

     whenever it is necessary to admit of your visits; a Black
     Servant opens the street-door, and the foot of the stair-
     case presents surtouts, boots, livery-cloths, a large blue
     coat with a yellow cape, and habiliments in which the
     opulent! array their servants. With these and similar
     merchant-like appearances Trade is commenced, and persons
     dispatched to provincial manufacturing towns, to buy various
     articles; for the amount of the first purchases, bills are
     drawn upon the Firm, and even before the goods are pack'd
     up, and sent according to order, the acceptances are paid,
     and, by this means, credit is partly established, which,
     once accomplished, they are in want of large assortments for
     exportation upon credit, at one, two, and three months. The
     goods are accordingly chosen and forwarded to their
     associates in London, where they are immediately disposed
     of at 20 or 30 per cent, cheaper than the prime cost, and
     the money realised. The first bills become due, are noted,
     and protested. The second are presented, but the House has
     stopped payment, and the Owners are bankrupts. By the time
     the third month's bills become due, the docket is struck,
     the Assignees chosen, and there is not sixpence in the pound
     left for the Creditors. Petitions are ineffectually
     presented to the Chancellor, for a number of fictitious
     Creditors, of the same profession and persuasion, over-swear
     the just ones, and by exceeding them in number and value,
     the House obtains its certificate, and has again the power
     of committing similar depredations.

     Perhaps the most daring and systematic proceeding of this
     kind was that lately detected in the conspiracy of Mosely
     Wolfe and his confederates, for which he is now suffering
     the sentence of the law.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>prides himself on his success, boasts of his being <i>down as a
nail</i>, and&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"<i>Down as a nail!</i>" said Bob, "I don't remember hearing that expression
before."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Down as a hammer, or Down as a nail</i>" continued Sparkle, "are cant or
slang terms made use of among gamblers, and are synonimous with being
up; and it must be confessed that there are many ups and downs amongst
them. These flash words are well understood by many a young Greek, who
perhaps knows nothing of the Greek Testament, although the use of them
has proved in some cases beyond the comprehension of a Judge. Hence the
necessity of knowing Life; for if a man gets familiarized with low life,
he will necessarily be up, and consequently stand a great chance of
being a rising genius. How proper it must be to know how to get a rise
upon a fellow, or, in other words, to get him in a line!
</p>
<p>
"A learned Judge once, examining a queer covy, a flash customer, or a
rum fellow, asked him his reason for suspecting the prisoner at the
bar of stealing a watch, (which among the lads is scientifically
termed nimming a toiler, or <span class="pagenum">[207]</span>nabbing a clicker,) replied as
follows:&mdash;'Why, your honour, only because you see as how I was up to
him.'&mdash;'How do you mean, what is being up to him? '&mdash;' Why, bless your
heart, I was down upon him, and had him bang.' But still perceiving the
learned Gentleman's want of nous, he endeavoured to explain by saying,
That he was <i>up to his gossip</i>,&mdash;that he stagged him, for he was not
to be done&mdash;that he knew the trick, and was up the moment the chap
came into the Cock and Hen Club, where he was tucking in his grub and
bub.&mdash;Had the learned Judge been up himself, much time and trouble might
have been saved; and indeed the importance of being down as a nail, to a
man of fashion, is almost incalculable; for this reason it is, that men
of high spirit think it no derogation from their dignity or rank, to be
well acquainted with all the slang of the coachman and stable-boy,
all the glossary of the Fancy, and all the mysterious language of
the scamps, the pads, the divers, and all upon the lay, which, by an
attentive and apt scholar, may easily be procured at a Gaming-house.
</p>
<p>
"Of Hells in general, it may fairly be asserted, that they are
infernally productive; no other line of business can be compared to
these money mills, since they are all thriving concerns, the proprietors
of which keep their country houses, extensive establishments, dashing
equipages; and
</p>
<pre>
          "While they have money they ride it in chaises.
          And look very big upon those that have none."
</pre>
<p>
"It certainly is a pity that men do not keep constantly in their
recollection, that no calculation of chances can avail them, and that
between the après, the limitation of stakes, and other manouvres, the
table must eventually be an immense winner.
</p>
<p>
"For Greeks stick at nothing to gain their own ends, And they sacrifice
all their acquaintance and friends;
</p>
<pre>
          And thus luckless P'&mdash;&mdash;n, to gain what he'd lost,
</pre>
<p>
Put his faith in a Greek, which he knows to his cost; Join'd a bank, as
he thought, when the sly Greeking elf Of a friend soon contriv'd for
to break it himself. You credulous pigeons! I would have you beware, Of
falling yourselves in a similar snare."
</p>
<p>
"We ought to consider ourselves greatly obliged," said Merry well, "for
the accurate description of characters <span class="pagenum">[208]</span>you have given. But have
you heard the report that is now in circulation, that a certain
Marquis of high military celebrity, and whose property is, or was, very
considerable, has lost almost his last shilling?"
</p>
<p>
"I," said Sparkle, "am seldom surprised at such rumours, particularly of
persons who are known to be players, for they are rich and poor in rapid
succession; but if there be any truth in the report, there is a fine
example of perseverance before him&mdash;for Lord &mdash;&mdash;, after a long run of
ill-luck, being refused the loan of an additional rouleau,{1} on
account of his score being rather long, left the company in dudgeon, and
determining on revenge, actually opened another Hell in opposition to
the one he had left, and by that means recovered all his money."
</p>
<p>
"That was well done," rejoined Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"It was rather too much of a trading concern for a Lord," said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Not for a gambling Lord," replied Merry well; "for there is in fact
nothing beneath a Greek, in the way of play: besides, it was a trying
situation, and required some desperate attempt&mdash;they care not who they
associate with, so they do but bring grist to the mill."
</p>
<p>
"The confusion of persons and characters at a Gaming-house," said
Sparkle, "are almost incredible, all ranks and descriptions are mingled
together.
</p>
<p>
"What confusion of titles and persons we see Amongst Gamesters, who
spring out of every degree, From the prince to the pauper; all panting
for play, Their fortune, their time, and their life pass away; Just as
mingled are Pigeons, for 'tis no rebuke For a Greek to pluck all, from a
Groom to a Duke."
</p>
<p>
"It is too true," said Dashall, "and equally as certain, that there are
continually new comers ready and willing to be duped, or at least ready
to risk their property, notwithstanding the warnings they have from
their more experienced friends."
</p>
<p>
"And is there no possibility of obtaining fair play?" inquired Bob, "or
redress for being pigeon'd, as you term it?"
</p>
<pre>
     1 A Rouleau&mdash;Is a packet containing one hundred guineas; but
     as guineas are not quite so fashionable in the present day
     as they formerly were, some of these Houses, for the
     accommodation of their customers, circulate guinea-notes
     upon their bankers.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>"None," said Sparkle; "for if men will play at bowls, they must
expect rubbers; and the system of confederacy is carried on every where,
though perhaps with most success in those professed Gambling-houses,
which young men of property ought carefully to avoid."
</p>
<p>
By this time they had reached the end of St. James's Street; it was
therefore proposed by Sparkle that they should separate, particularly
as it was growing late, or rather early in the morning; and, as they had
been in some degree baffled in their attempt to take a minute survey
of the proceedings in Pall Mall, they had no decided object in
view. Accordingly they parted, Tom and Bob pursuing their way along
Piccadilly, while Sparkle, Merrywell, and Mortimer, proceeded down Bond
Street.
</p>
<p>
"I am by no means satisfied," said Tom, "with this evening's ramble, nor
exactly pleased to find our friend Sparkle is getting so sentimental."
</p>
<p>
"He is, at least," said Tallyho, "very communicative and instructive&mdash;I
should feel less embarrassment at a future visit to one of those
places, though, I can assure you, I should carefully avoid the chance of
becoming a pigeon; but to know these things is certainly useful."
</p>
<p>
"We must lay our plans better for the future," said Tom&mdash;"example is
better than precept; and, as for Sparkle, I strongly suspect he is
studying a part in All for Love, or the World well lost. That kind of
study is too laborious for me, I can't bear to be fettered; or if it be
true that it is what we must all come to, my time is not yet arrived.
Though I confess Miss Mortimer has many attractions not to be overlooked
by an attentive observer; at the same time I perceive this Mr. Merrywell
is equally assiduous to obtain the young lady's favours."
</p>
<p>
By this time they had arrived at home, where, after partaking of
refreshment, they retired to rest.<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>

    CHAPTER XV
</h2>
<pre>
          "Cataracts of declamation thunder here,
          There, forests of no meaning spread the page,
          In which all comprehension wanders, lost,
          While fields of pleasantry amuse us there
          With many descants on a nation's woes.
          The rest appears a wilderness of strange,
          But gay confusion&mdash;roses for the cheeks,
          And lilies for the brows of faded age;
          Teeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,
          Heav'n, earth, and ocean, plunder'd of their sweets;
          Nectareous essences, Olympian dews,
          Sermons and City feasts, and fav'rite airs,
          Ethereal journeys, submarine exploits,
          And Katerfelto with his hair on end,
          At his own wonders wond'ring for his bread."
</pre>
<p>
"WELL," said Tom, "it must be confessed that a Newspaper is a most
convenient and agreeable companion to the breakfast-table," laying
down the <i>Times</i> as he spoke: "it is a sort of literary hotch-potch,
calculated to afford amusement suited to all tastes, rank-, and degrees;
it contains
</p>
<pre>
          "Tales of love and maids mistaken,
          Of battles fought, and captives taken."
</pre>
<p>
"Then, I presume," said Bob, "you have been gratified and interested in
the perusal?"
</p>
<p>
"It is impossible to look down the columns of a newspaper," replied Tom,
"without finding subjects to impart light; and of all the journals
of the present day, the <i>Times</i> appears to me the best in point of
information and conduct; but I spoke of newspapers generally, there
is such a mixture of the <i>utile et dulce</i>, that the Merchant and the
Mechanic, the Peer, the Poet, the Prelate, and the Peasant, are all
deeply concerned in its contents. In truth, a newspaper is so true a
mark of the caprice of Englishmen, that it may justly be styled their
coat of <span class="pagenum">[211]</span>arms. The Turkish Koran is not near so sacred to a
rigid Mahometan&mdash;a parish-dinner to an Overseer&mdash;a turtle-feast to an
Alderman, or an election to a Freeholder, as a Gazette or Newspaper to
an Englishman: by it the motions of the world are watched, and in some
degree governed&mdash;the arts and sciences protected and promoted&mdash;the
virtuous supported and stimulated&mdash;the vicious reproved and
corrected&mdash;and all informed."
</p>
<p>
"Consequently," said Bob, "a good Newspaper is really a valuable
article."
</p>
<p>
"Doubtless," continued Tom; "and John Bull&mdash;mistake me not, I don't
mean the paper which bears that title&mdash;I mean the population of England,
enjoy a Newspaper, and there are some who could not relish their
breakfasts without one; it is a sort of general sauce to every thing,
and to the <i>quid nunc</i> is indispensable&mdash;for if one informs him of a
naval armament, he will not fail to toast the Admirals all round in pint
bumpers to each, wishes them success, gets drunk with excessive loyalty,
and goes with his head full of seventy-fours, sixty-fours, frigates,
transports, fire-ships, &amp;c. In its diversified pages, persons of every
rank, denomination, and pursuit, may be informed&mdash;the Philosopher, the
Politician, the Citizen, the Handicraftsman, and the Gossip, are regaled
by the novelty of its contents, the minuteness of its details, and the
refreshing arrivals of transactions which occupy the attention of human
beings at the greatest or nearest distances from us&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "&mdash;&mdash;a messenger of grief
          Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some:
          What is it but a map of life,
          Its fluctuations and its vast concerns?"
</pre>
<p>
It may with propriety be compared to the planetary system: the light
which it diffuses round the mental hemisphere, operates according as
it is seen, felt, understood, or enjoyed: for instance, the Miser
is gladdened by an account of the rise of the stocks&mdash;the Mariner
is rejoiced, at the safety of his vessel after a thunder-storm&mdash;the
Manufacturer, to hear of the revival of foreign markets&mdash;the Merchant,
that his cargo is safely arrived&mdash;the Member, that his election is
secured&mdash;the Father, that his son is walling to return home&mdash;the
Poet, that <span class="pagenum">[212]</span>his production has been favourably received by the
public&mdash;the Physician, that a difficult cure is transmitting his fame
to posterity&mdash;the Actor, that his talents are duly appreciated&mdash;the
Agriculturist, that grain fetches a good price&mdash;the upright man, that
his character is defended&mdash;the poor man, that beer, meat, bread, and
vegetables, are so within his reach that he can assure himself of being
able to obtain a good Sunday's dinner.
</p>
<p>
"Tho' they differ in narrie, all alike, just the same, Morning
Chronicle, Times, Advertiser, British Press, Morning Post, of News&mdash;what
a host We read every day, and grow wiser; The Examiner, Whig&mdash;all alive
to the gig, While each one his favourite chooses; Star, Traveller, and
Sun, to keep up the fun, And tell all the world what the news is."
</p>
<p>
"Well done," said Bob, "you seem to have them all at your tongue's end,
and their general contents in your head; but, for my part, I am struck
with surprise to know how it is they find interesting matter enough at
all times to fill their columns."
</p>
<p>
"Nothing more easy," continued Dashall, "especially for a newspaper
whose contents are not sanctioned by authority; in which case they are
so much the more the receptacle of invention&mdash;thence&mdash;We hear&mdash;it is
said&mdash;a correspondent remarks&mdash;whereas, &amp;c&mdash;all which serve to please,
surprise, and inform. We hear, can alter a man's face as the weather
would a barometer&mdash;It is said, can distort another like a fit of the
spasm&mdash;If, can make some cry&mdash;while Suppose, can make others laugh&mdash;but
a Whereas operates like an electric shock; and though it often runs the
extremity of the kingdom in unison with the rest, they altogether form
a very agreeable mixture, occasionally interspersed, as opportunity
offers, with long extracts from the last published novel, and an
account of the prevailing fashions. But domestic occurrences form a very
essential part of this folio: thus, a marriage hurts an old maid and
mortifies a young one, while it consoles many a poor dejected husband,
who is secretly pleased to find another fallen into his case&mdash;a death,
if of a wife, makes husbands envy the widower, while, perhaps, some one
of the women who censure his alleged want of <span class="pagenum">[213]</span>decent sorrow, marry
him within a month after&mdash;in fact, every person is put in motion by a
Newspaper.
</p>

          "Here various news is found, of love and strife;
          Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life;
          Of loss and gain, of famine and of store;
          Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore;
          Of prodigies and portents seen in air;
          Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair;
          Of turns of fortune, changes in the state,
          The falls of favourites, projects of the great."

<p>
"It is a bill of fare, containing all the luxuries as well as
necessaries, of life. Politics, for instance, are the roast beef of the
times; essays, the plum pudding; and poetry the fritters, confections,
custards, and all the <i>et cotera</i> of the table, usually denominated
trifles. Yet the four winds are not liable to more mutability than
the vehicles of these entertainments; for instance, on Monday, it
is whispered&mdash;on Tuesday, it is rumoured&mdash;on Wednesday, it is
conjectured&mdash;on Thursday, it is probable&mdash;on Friday, it is positively
asserted&mdash;and, on Saturday, it is premature. But notwithstanding this,
some how or other, all are eventually pleased; for, as the affections
of all are divided among wit, anecdote, poetry, prices of stocks, the
arrival of ships, &amp;c. a Newspaper is a repository where every one has
his hobby-horse; without it, coffee-houses, &amp;c. would be depopulated,
and the country squire, the curate, the exciseman, and the barber, and
many others, would lose those golden opportunities of appearing so very
wise as they do.
</p>
<p>
A Newspaper may also be compared to the Seasons. Its information varies
on the roll of Time, and much of it passes away as a Winter, giving many
a bitter pang of the death of a relative or hopeful lover; it is as a
Spring, for, in the time of war and civil commotion, its luminary, the
editor, like the morning sun, leads Hope forward to milder days and
happier prospects&mdash;the smiles of peace; it is the heart's Summer
calendar, giving news of marriages and births for heirs and patrons;
it is the Autumn of joy, giving accounts of plenty, and guarding the
avaricious against the snares of self-love, and offering arguments in
favour of humanity. It is more; a Newspaper is one of the most faithful
lessons that can be represented to our reflections, for, while it is the
interpreter <span class="pagenum">[214]</span>of the general economy of nature, it is a most kind and
able instructress to improve ourselves.
</p>
<p>
What are our lives but as the ephemeral appearance of an advertisement?
Our actions but as the actions of a popular contest? Our hopes, fears,
exultations, but as the cross readings of diurnal events? And although
grief is felt at the perusal of accidents, offences, and crimes, which
are necessarily and judiciously given, there is in every good Newspaper
an impartial record, an abstract of the times, a vast fund of useful
knowledge; and, finally, no person has reason, after perusing it, to
rise without being thankful that so useful a medium is offered to his
understanding; at least, this is my opinion."
</p>
<p>
"And now you have favoured me with this opinion," rejoined Tallyho,
"will you be kind enough to inform me to what fortunate circumstance I
am indebted for it?"
</p>
<p>
"The question comes very apropos," continued Tom&mdash;"for I had nearly
forgotten that circumstance, so that you may perhaps be inclined to
compare my head to a newspaper, constantly varying from subject to
subject; but no matter, a novelty has just struck my eye, which I
think will afford us much gratification: it is the announcement of
an exhibition of engravings by living artists, under the immediate
patronage of his Majesty, recently opened in Soho Square, through the
public spirited exertions of Mr. Cooke, a celebrated engraver&mdash;And now
I think of it, Mortimer and his Sister intend visiting Somerset
House&mdash;egad! we will make a morning of it in reviewing the Arts&mdash;what
say you?"
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart," returned Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Be it so, then," said Tom&mdash;"So-ho, my boy&mdash;perhaps we may meet the
love-sick youth, poor Sparkle; he has certainly received the wound of
the blind urchin&mdash;I believe we must pity him&mdash;but come, let us prepare,
we will lounge away an hour in walking down Bond Street&mdash;peep at the
wags and the wag-tails, and take Soho Square in our way to Somerset
House. I feel myself just in the humour for a bit of gig, and 1 promise
you we will make a night of it."
</p>
<p>
The preliminaries of their route being thus arranged, in half an hour
they were on their road down Bond Street, marking and remarking upon
circumstances and subjects as they arose.
</p>
<p>
"Who is that Lady?" said Bob, seeing Tom bow as a dashing carriage passed
them.
</p>
<p>
"That is a Lady Townley, according to the generally
</p>
<p>
received term."
</p>
<p>
"A lady of title, as I suspected," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, yes," replied Tom Dashall, "a distinguished personage, I can
assure you&mdash;one of the most dashing demireps of the present day, basking
at this moment in the plenitude of her good fortune. She is however
deserving of a better fate: well educated and brought up, she was early
initiated into the mysteries and miseries of high life. You seem to
wonder at the title I have given her."
</p>
<p>
"I am astonished again, I confess," replied Bob; "but it appears there
is no end to wonders in London&mdash;nor can I guess how you so accurately
know them."
</p>
<p>
"Along residence in London affords opportunities for
</p>
<p>
discovery.
</p>
<p>
"As the French very justly say, that <i>Il n'y a que le premier pas qui
coûte</i>, and just as, with all the sapience of medicine, there is but
a degree betwixt the Doctor and the Student, so, after the first step,
there is but a degree betwixt the Demirep and the gazetted Cyprian, who
is known by head-mark to every insipid Amateur and Fancier in the town.
</p>
<p>
"The number of these frail ones is so great, that, if I were to attempt
to go through the shades and gradations, the distinctions and titles,
from the promiscuous Duchess to the interested Marchande de mode, and
from her down to the Wood Nymphs of the English Opera, there would
be such a longo ordine génies, that although it is a very interesting
subject, well worthy of investigation, it would occupy a considerable
portion of time; however, I will give you a slight sketch of some
well known and very topping articles. Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;m, commonly called
B&mdash;&mdash;g, Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;n, and Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;d, of various life. "The modern
Pyrrha, B&mdash;&mdash;g, has a train as long as an eastern monarch, but it is
a train of lovers. The Honourable B&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;n, that famous gentleman
miller, had the honour at one time (like Cromwell,) of being the
Protector of the Republic. The infamous Greek, bully, informer and
reprobate W&mdash;&mdash;ce, was her accomplice and paramour at another. Lord
V&mdash;&mdash;l boasted her favours at a third period; and she wished to look
upon him in a fatherly <span class="pagenum">[216]</span>light; but it would not do. Mr. C. T. S.
the nephew of a great naval character, is supposed to have a greater
or prior claim there; but the piebald harlequin is owned not by "Light
horse, but by heavy."
</p>
<p>
"Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;y, however, was so struck with the increased
</p>
<p>
attractions of this Cyprian, that he offered to be her protector during
a confinement which may be alarming to many, but interesting to a few.
This was being doubly diligent, and accordingly as it was two to one in
his favour, no wonder he succeeded in his suit. The difficulties which
Madame laboured under were sufficient to decide her in this youth's
favour; and the preference, upon such an occasion, must have been highly
flattering to him. On the score of difficulties, Cyprians are quite in
fashion; for executions and arrests are very usual in their mansions,
and the last comer has the exquisite felicity of relieving them.
</p>
<p>
"Although this dashing Lady was the daughter of a bathing woman at
Brighton, she was not enabled to keep her head above water.
</p>
<p>
"I must not forget Poll P&mdash;&mdash;n, whose select friends have such cause
to be proud of lier election. This Diana is not descended from a member
of the Rump Parliament, nor from a bum bailiff; but was the daughter
of a bumboat woman at Plymouth. She has, however, since that period,
commenced business for herself; and that in such a respectable and
extensive line, that she counts exactly seven thousand customers! all
regularly booked. What a delectable amusement to keep such a register!
<i>Neanmoins</i>, or <i>nean plus</i>, if you like. It is reported that the noble
Y&mdash;&mdash; was so delighted with her at the Venetian fête given by Messrs.
W&mdash;ll&mdash;ms and D&mdash;h&mdash;r&mdash;ty, that he gave the Virgin Unmasked several very
valuable presents, item, a shawl value one hundred guineas, &amp;c. and
was honoured by being put on this Prime Minister of the Court of Love's
list&mdash;number Seven thousand and one! What a fortunate man!
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;d is lineally descended, not from William the Conqueror,
but from W&mdash;&mdash;s the coachman. She lived, for a considerable time, in
a mews, and it was thought that it was his love for the <i>Muses</i> which
attached C&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash; so closely to her. She was seduced at a most
indelicately juvenile age by a Major M&mdash;&mdash;l, who protected her but
a short time, and then deserted her. Then <span class="pagenum">[217]</span>she became what the
Cyprians term Lady Townly, till Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;d, a youth with considerable
West India property in expectation, married her.
</p>
<p>
"On this happy occasion, her hymeneal flame burned with so much warmth
and purity, that she shared it with a linen-draper, and the circumstance
became almost immediately known to the husband! This was a happy
presage of future connubial felicity! The very day before this domestic
exposure, and the happy vigil of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;d's happier "<i>jour des
noces</i>," the darling of the Muses or Mewses, Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; procured Lady
H&mdash;&mdash;d's private box for her at one of the theatres, whither she and
Mrs. CI&mdash;&mdash;y, the mistress of an officer of that name, repaired in the
carriage of the Mews lover, which has become completely "the Demirep or
Cyprian's Diligence," and these patterns for the fair sex had poured out
such plentiful libations to Bacchus, that her ladyship's box exhibited
the effects of their devotions! What a regale for the Princess of
Madagascar!
</p>
<p>
"The guardians, or trustees, of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;d now withheld his property,
and Madame assisted him into the King's Bench, during which time she
kept terms with Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; at Oxford. On her return, she got acquainted
with a Capt. Cr&mdash;&mdash;ks, whom she contrived soon afterwards to lodge, in
the next room to her husband, in the Bench; but to whom she kindly gave
the preference in her visits.
</p>
<p>
"Whether C&mdash;&mdash; L&mdash;&mdash;, W&mdash;lk&mdash;s the linen-draper, or Capt. C&mdash;&mdash;k,
be the most favoured swain, or swine, I venture not to say; but the
former has devoted his time, his chariot, and his female acquaintances'
boxes in public to her. As a pledge of his love, she helped herself to
a loose picture of great value belonging to him, which very nearly fell
into the hands of John Doe or Richard Roe, on her husband's account,
afterwards. The palm should, however, certainly be given to Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;,
as he courted her classically, moralized to her sentimentally, sung
psalms and prayed with her fervently, and, on all occasions, treated her
like a lady."
</p>
<p>
"Ha," said a fashionably dressed young man, who approached towards
Dashall, "Ha, my dear fellow, how goes it with you? Haven't seen
you this month; d&mdash;&mdash;d unlucky circumstance&mdash;wanted you very much
indeed&mdash;glorious sport&mdash;<i>all jolly and bang up</i>." <span class="pagenum">[218]</span>"Glad to hear
it," said Tom,&mdash;"sorry you should have experienced any wants on my
account."
</p>
<p>
"Which way are you going? Come along, I'll tell you of such a
spree&mdash;regular, and nothing but&mdash;You must know, a few days ago,
sauntering down Bond-street, I overtook Sir G. W. 'Ha! my gay fellow,'
said he, 'I thought you were at Bibury; you're the very man I want. My
brother Jack has lost a rump and dozen to a young one, and we want to
make up a select party, a set of real hardheaded fellows, to share
the feast. I have already recruited Sir M. M., the buck Parson, Lord
Lavender, and Tom Shuffleton. Then there's yourself, I hope, my brother
and I, the young one, and A&mdash;&mdash;'s deputy, the reprobate Curate, whom
we will have to make fun of. We dine at half-past seven, at Long's, and
there will be some sport, I assure you.'
</p>
<p>
"I accepted the invitation, and met the company before mentioned. A
rump and dozen is always a nominal thing. There was no rump, except
Lavender's, which projects like a female's from the bottom of a
tight-laced pair of stays; and as for the dozen, I believe we drank
nearer three dozen of different expensive wines, which were tasted one
after the other with a quickness of succession, which at last left no
taste, but a taste for more drink, and for all sorts of wickedness.
</p>
<p>
"This tasting plan is a very successful trick of tavern keepers, which
enables them to carry off half bottles of wine, to swell the reckoning
most amazingly, and so to bewilder people as to the qualities of the
wine, that any thing, provided it be strong and not acid, will go down
at the heel of the evening. It is also a grand manouvre; to intoxicate
a Johnny Raw, and to astonish his weak mind with admiration for the
founder of the feast. Therefore, the old trick of 'I have got some
particularly high-flavoured Burgundy, which Lord Lavender very much
approved t'other day;' and, 'Might I, Sir, ask your opinion of a new
importation of Sillery?' or, 'My Lord, 1 have bought all the Nabob's
East India Madeira,' &amp;c. was successfully practised.
</p>
<p>
"Through the first course we were stag-hunting, to a man, and killed
the stag just as the second course came on the table. This course was
occupied by a great number of long shots of Sir M. M., and by Lavender
offering to back himself and the buck Parson against any other two
<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>men in England, as to the number of head of game which they would
bag from sun-rise to sun-set upon the moors. A foot race, and a dispute
as to the odds betted on the second October Meeting, occupied the
third course. The desert was enlivened by a list of ladies of all
descriptions, whose characters were cut up full as ably as the haunch of
venison was carved; and here boasting of success in love was as general
as the custom is base. One man of fashion goes by the name of Kiss and
tell.
</p>
<p>
"After an hour of hard drinking, as though it had been for a wager, a
number of very manly, nice little innocent and instructive amusements
were resorted to. We had a most excellent maggot race for a hundred; and
then a handycap for a future poney race. We had pitching a guinea into a
decanter, at which the young one lost considerably. We had a raffle
for a gold snuff box, a challenge of fifty against Lord Lavender's
Dusseldorf Pipe, and five hundred betted upon the number of shot to be
put into a Joe Manton Rifle. We played at <i>te-to-tum</i>; and the young
one leaped over a handkerchief six feet high for a wager: he performed
extremely well at first, but at last Lavender, who betted against him,
kept plying him so with wine, and daring him to an inch higher and
higher, until at last the young one broke his nose, and lost five
hundred guineas by his boyish diversion.
</p>
<p>
Now we had a fulminating letter introduced as a hoax upon Shuffleton;
next, devils and broiled bones; then some blasphemous songs from the
Curate, who afterwards fell asleep, and thus furnished an opportunity
for having his face blacked. We then got in a band of itinerant
musicians; put crackers in their pockets; cut off one fellow's tail; and
had a milling match betwixt the baronet in the chair and the stoutest of
them, who, having had spirits of wine poured over his head, refused to
let the candle be put to it!
</p>
<p>
Peace being restored, a regular supper appeared; and then a regular
set-to at play, where I perceived divers signals thrown out, such as
rubbing of foreheads and chins, taking two pinches of snuff and other
private telegraphic communications, the result of which was, the young
one, just of age, being greeked to a very great amount.
</p>
<p>
We now sallied forth, like a pack in full cry, with all the loud
expression of mirth and riot, and proceeded to <span class="pagenum">[220]</span>old 77, which, being
shut up, we swore like troopers, and broke the parlour windows in a
rage. We next cut the traces of a hackney coach, and led the horses into
a mews, ?where we tied them up; coachee being asleep inside the whole
time. We then proceeded to old <i>Ham-a-dry-ed</i>, the bacon man's, called
out Fire, and got the old man down to the door in his shirt, when
Lavender ran away with his night-cap, and threw it into the water in
St. James's Square, whilst the Baronet put it in right and left at his
sconce, and told him to hide his d&mdash;&mdash;d ugly masard. This induced him
to come out and call the Watch, during which time the buck Parson got
into his house, and was very snug with the cook wench until the next
evening, when <i>old fusty mug</i> went out upon business.
</p>
<p>
After giving a view holloa! we ran off, with the Charleys in full cry
after us, when Sir G. W., who had purposely provided himself with a long
cord, gave me one end, and ran to the opposite side of Jermyn Street
with the other in his hand, holding it about two feet from the pavement.
The old Scouts came up in droves, and we had 'em down in a moment, for
every mother's son of the guardians were caught in the trap, and rolled
over each other slap into the kennel. Never was such a prime bit of gig!
They lay stunn'd with the fall&mdash;broken lanterns, staves, rattles, Welsh
wigs, night-caps and old hats, were scattered about in abundance, while
grunting, growling, and swearing was heard in all directions. One
old buck got his jaw-bone broken; another staved in two of his crazy
timbers, that is to say, broke a couple of ribs; a third bled from the
nose like a pig; a fourth squinted admirably from a pair of painted
peepers; their numbers however increasing, we divided our forces and
marched in opposite directions; one party sallied along Bond Street,
nailed up a snoosy Charley in his box, and bolted with his lantern: the
others were not so fortunate, for A&mdash;&mdash;'s deputy cushion thumper, the
young one, and the Baronet's brother, got safely lodged in St. James's
Watch-house.
</p>
<p>
"Broad daylight now glar'd upon us&mdash;Lavender retired comfortably upon
Madame la Comtesse in the Bench; Sir M. M. was found chanting Cannons
with some Wood nymphs not an hundred and fifty miles off from Leicester
Square; I had the President to carry home on my shoulders, bundled
to bed, and there I lay sick for four and twenty hours, when a little
inspiring Coniac brought <span class="pagenum">[221]</span>me to my senses again, and now I am ready
and ripe for another spree. Stap my vitals if there isn't Lavender&mdash;my
dear fellow, adieu&mdash;remember me to Charley Sparkle when you see him&mdash;by,
by." And with this he sprung across the road, leaving Bob and his Cousin
to comment at leisure upon his folly.
</p>
<p>
They were however soon aroused from their reflections by perceiving a
Groom in livery advancing rapidly towards them, followed by a curricle,
moving at the rate of full nine miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
"Who have we here?" said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"A character well known," said Tom; "that is Lady L&mdash;&mdash;, a dashing
female whip of the first order&mdash;mark how she manages her tits&mdash;take a
peep at her costume and learn while you look."
</p>
<p>
"More than one steed must Delia's empire feel Who sits triumphant o'er
the flying wheel; And as she guides it through th' admiring throng, With
what an air she smacks the silken thong!"
</p>
<p>
The Lady had a small round riding-hat, of black beaver, and sat in the
true attitude of a coachman&mdash;wrists pliant, elbows square, she handled
her whip in a scientific manner; and had not Tom declared her sex, Bob
would hardly have discovered it from her outward appearance. She was
approaching them at a brisk trot, greeting her numerous acquaintance as
she passed with familiar nods, at each giving her horses an additional
touch, and pursing up her lips to accelerate their speed; indeed, she
was so intent upon the management of her reins, and her eyes so fixed
upon her cattle, that there was no time for more than a sort of sidelong
glance of recognition; and every additional smack of the whip seem'd to
say, "<i>Here I come&mdash;that's your sort</i>." Her whole manner indeed was
very similar to what may be witnessed in Stage-coachmen, Hackneymen,
and fashionable Ruffians, who appear to think that all merit consists in
copying them when they tip a brother whip the go-by, or almost graze the
wheel of a Johnny-raw, and turn round with a grin of self-approbation,
as much as to say&mdash;"<i>What d'ye think of that now, eh f&mdash;there's a touch
for you&mdash;lord, what a flat you must be!</i>"
</p>
<p>
Bob gazed with wonder and astonishment as she passed.
</p>
<p>
"How?" said he, "do the ladies of London frequently take the whip?&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>"&mdash;Hand of their husbands as well as their horses," replied
Tom&mdash;"often enough, be assured."
</p>
<p>
"But how, in the name of wonder, do they learn to drive in this style?"
</p>
<p>
"Easily enough; inclination and determination will accomplish their
objects. Why, among the softer sex, we have female Anatomists&mdash;female
Students in Natural History&mdash;Sculptors, and Mechanics of all
descriptions&mdash;Shoe-makers and Match-makers&mdash;and why not Charioteers?"
</p>
<p>
"Nay, I am not asking why; but as it appears rather out of the common
way, I confess my ignorance has excited my curiosity on a subject which
seems somewhat out of nature."
</p>
<p>
"I have before told you, Nature has nothing to do with Real Life in
London."
</p>
<p>
"And yet," continued Bob, "we are told, and I cannot help confessing the
truth of the assertion, with respect to the ladies, that
</p>
<pre>
          "&mdash;&mdash;Loveliness
          Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,
          But is, when unadorned, adorn'd the most,"
          This certainly implies a natural or native grace."
</pre>
<p>
"Pshaw," said Dashall, "that was according to the Old school; such
doctrines are completely exploded now-a-days, for Fashion is at variance
with Nature in all her walks; hence, driving is considered one of the
accomplishments necessary to be acquired by the female sex in high life,
by which an estimate of character may be formed: for instance&mdash;if a lady
take the reins of her husband, her brother, or a lover, it is strongly
indicative of assuming the mastery; but should she have no courage or
muscular strength, and pays no attention to the art of governing and
guiding her cattle, it is plain that she will become no driver, no whip,
and may daily run the risk of breaking the necks of herself and friends.
If however she should excel in this study, she immediately becomes
masculine and severe, and she punishes, when occasion requires, every
animal within the reach of her lash&mdash;acquires an ungraceful attitude and
manner&mdash;heats her complexion by over exertion&mdash;sacrifices her softness
to accomplish her intentions&mdash;runs a risk of having hard hands, and
perhaps a hard heart: at all events she gains unfeminine habits, and
<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>such as are found very difficult to get rid of, and prides herself
on being the go, the gaze, the gape, the stare of all who see her."
</p>
<p>
"A very admirable, and no doubt equally happy state," quoth Bob, half
interrupting him.
</p>
<p>
"If she learn the art of driving from the family coachman, it cannot
be doubted but such tuition is more than likely to give her additional
grace, and to teach her all that is polite; and then the pleasure of
such company whilst superintending her studies, must tend to improve her
mind; the freedom of these teachers of coachmanship, and the language
peculiar to themselves, at first perhaps not altogether agreeable, is
gradually worn away by the pride of becoming an accomplished whip&mdash;to
know how to <i>turn a corner in style&mdash;tickle Snarler in the ear&mdash;cut up
the yelper&mdash;take out a fly's eye in bang-up twig</i>."
</p>
<p>
"Excellent! indeed," cried Bob, charmed with Dashall's irony, and
willing to provoke it farther; "and pray, when this art of driving
is thoroughly learned, what does it tend to but a waste of time, a
masculine enjoyment, and a loss of feminine character&mdash;of that sweet,
soft and overpowering submission to and reliance on the other sex,
which, whilst it demands our protection and assistance, arouses our
dearest sympathies&mdash;our best interests&mdash;attaches, enraptures, and
subdues us?"
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense," continued Tom, "you might ask such questions for a
month&mdash;who cares about these submissions and reliances&mdash;protections and
sympathies&mdash;they are not known, at least it is very unfashionable to
acknowledge their existence. Why I have known ladies so infatuated and
affected by an inordinate love of charioteering, that it has completely
altered them, not only as to dress, but manners and feeling, till
at length they have become more at home in the stable than the
drawing-room; and some, that are so different when dressed for dinner,
that the driving habiliments appear like complete masquerade disguises.
Indeed, any thing that is natural is considered quite out of nature; and
this affectation is not wholly confined to the higher circles, for in
the City even the men and the women seem to have changed places.
</p>
<pre>
          "Man-milliners and mantua-makers swarm
          With clumsy hands to deck the female form&mdash;
          With brawny limbs to fit fine ladies' shapes,
          Or measure out their ribbons, lace and tapes;
          Or their rude eye the bosom's swell surveys,
          To cut out corsets or to stitch their stays;
          Or making essences and soft perfume,
          Or paint, to give the pallid cheek fresh bloom;
          Or with hot irons, combs, and frizzling skill,
          On ladies' heads their daily task fulfil;
          Or, deeply versed in culinary arts,

          Or, clad in motley coat, the footman neat
          Is dangling after Miss with shuffling feet,
          Bearing in state to church her book of pray'r,

          The tea and bread and butter hands about.
          Where are the women, whose less nervous hands
          Might fit these lighter tasks, which pride demands?
          Some feel the scorn that poverty attends,
          Or pine in meek dépendance on their friends;
          Some patient ply the needle day by day,
          Poor half-paid seamsters, wasting life away;
          Some drudge in menial, dirty, ceaseless toil,
          Bear market loads, or grovelling weed the soil;
          Some walk abroad, a nuisance where they go,
          And snatch from infamy the bread of woe."

"It is a strange sort of infatuation, this fashion," said Bob, "and it
is much to be regretted it should operate so much to the injury of the
fair&mdash;"

<p>
"Do you see that young man on the opposite side of the way,"inquired
Dashall,(stopping him short) "in nankin breeches and jockey-boots?"
</p>
<p>
"I do," replied Tallyho; "and pray who is he?"
</p>
<p>
"The son of a wealthy Baronet who, with an eye to the main chance in
early life, engaged in some mercantile speculations, which proving
productive concerns, have elevated him to his present dignity, beyond
which it is said he cannot go on account of his having once kept a shop.
This son is one of what may be termed the <i>Ciphers of society</i>, a sort
of useful article, like an 0 in arithmetic, to denominate numbers;
one of those characters, if character it may be termed, of which this
Metropolis and its vicinity would furnish us with regiments. Indeed, the

<p>
1 It is related that a young lady of <i>haut ton</i> in Paris was observed
to have a tall fellow always following her wherever she went. Her
grandmother one day asked her what occasion there was for that man to be
always following her; to which she replied&mdash;"I must blow my nose, must
not I, when I want?" This great genius was actually employed to carry
her pocket-handkerchief. <span class="pagenum">[225]</span>general run of Fashionables are little
better than Ciphers,&mdash;very necessary at times in the House of Commons,
to suit the purposes and forward the intentions of the Ministers,
by which they obtain <i>titles</i> to which they are not <i>entitled,</i> and
transmit to posterity a race of ennobled boobies. What company, what
society does not abound with Ciphers, and oftentimes in such plenty that
they are even serviceable to make the society considerable? What could
we do to express on paper five hundred without the two ciphers, or being
compelled to write eleven letters to explain what is equally well done
in three figures? These Ciphers are useful at general meetings upon
public questions, though, if they were all collected together in point
of intellectual value, they would amount to nought. They are equally
important as counters at a card-table, they tell for more than they are
worth. Among the City Companies there are many of them to be found: and
the Army is not deficient, though great care is generally taken to send
the most conspicuous Ciphers on foreign service. Public offices under
Government swarm with them; and how many round O's or ciphers may be
found among the gentlemen of the long robe, who, as Hudibras observes,
</p>
<pre>
          "&mdash;&mdash;never ope
          Their mouths, but out there flies a trope."
</pre>
<p>
In the twelve Judges it must be allowed there is no cipher, because they
have two figures to support them; but take these two figures away, and
the whole wit of mankind may be defied to patch up or recruit the number
without having recourse to the race of Ciphers.
</p>
<p>
"I have known a Cipher make a profound Statesman and a Secretary&mdash;nay,
an Ambassador; but then it must be confess'd it has been by the timely
and prudent application of proper supporters; and it is certain, that
Ciphers have more than once shewn themselves significant in high posts
and stations, and in more reigns than one. Bounteous nature indulges
mankind in a boundless variety of characters as well as features, and
has given Ciphers to make up numbers, and very often by such additions
renders the few much more significant and conspicuous. The Church has
its Ciphers&mdash;for a mitre looks as well on a round 0 as on any letter in
the alphabet, <span class="pagenum">[226]</span>and the expense to the nation is equally the same;
consequently, John Bull has no right to complain.
</p>
<pre>
          "See in Pomposo a polite divine,
          More gay than grave, not half so sound as fine;
          The ladies' parson, proudly skill'd is he,
          To 'tend their toilet and pour out their tea;
          Foremost to lead the dance, or patient sit
          To deal the cards out, or deal out small wit;
          Then oh! in public, what a perfect beau,
          So powder'd and so trimm'd for pulpit show;
          So well equipp'd to tickle ears polite
          With pretty little subjects, short and trite.
          Well cull'd and garbled from the good old store
          Of polish'd sermons often preached before;
          With precious scraps from moral Shakespeare brought.
          To fill up awkward vacancies of thought,
          Or shew how he the orator can play
          Whene'er he meets with some good thing to say,
          Or prove his taste correct, his memory strong,
          Nor let his fifteen minutes seem too long:
          His slumbering mind no knotty point pursues,
          Save when contending for his tithes or dues."
</pre>
<p>
Thus far, although it must be allowed that ciphers are of use, it is not
every cipher that is truly useful. There are Ciphers of indolence, to
which some mistaken men give the title of men of fine parts&mdash;there are
Ciphers of Self-interest, to which others more wrongfully give the name
of Patriots&mdash;there are Bacchanalian Ciphers, who will not leave the
bottle to save the nation, but will continue to guzzle till no one
figure in Arithmetic is sufficient to support them&mdash;then there are
Ciphers of Venus, who will abandon all state affairs to follow a
Cyprian, even at the risk of injuring a deserving wife&mdash;Military
Ciphers, who forsake the pursuit of glory, and distrustful of their own
merit or courage, affirm their distrust by a sedulous attendance at the
levees of men of power. In short, every man, in my humble opinion, is
no other than a Cipher who does not apply his talents to the care of his
morals and the benefit of his country."
</p>
<p>
"You have been ciphering for some time," said Boh, "and I suppose you
have now finished your sum."
</p>
<p>
"I confess," continued Tom, "it has been a puzzling one&mdash;for, to make
something out of nothing is impossible."
</p>
<p>
"Not in all cases," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"How so?&mdash;why you have proved it by your own shewing, that these
nothings are to be made something of."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>"I perceive," replied Tom, "that your acquaintance with Sparkle is
not thrown away upon you; and it argues well, for if you are so ready
a pupil at imbibing his lessons, you will soon become a proficient
in London manners and conversation; but a Cipher is like a <i>round
robin</i>,{1} it has neither beginning nor end: its centre is vacancy,
its circle ambiguity, and it stands for nothing, unless in certain
connections."
</p>
<p>
They were now proceeding gently along Oxford Street, in pursuit of their
way to Soho Square, and met with little worthy of note or remark until
they arrived near the end of Newman Street, where a number of workmen
were digging up the earth for the purpose of making new-drains. The
pathway was railed from the road by scaffolding poles strongly driven
into the ground, and securely tied together to prevent interruption from
the passengers.&mdash;Tom was remarking upon the hardihood and utility of
the labourers at the moment when a fountain of water was issuing from
a broken pipe, which arose as high as a two pair of stairs window, a
circumstance which quickly drew a number of spectators around, and,
among the rest, Tom and his Cousin could not resist an inclination to
spend a few minutes in viewing the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
The Irish <i>jontlemen</i>, who made two or three ineffectual attempts to
stop the breach, alternately got soused by the increased violence of
the water, and at every attempt were saluted by the loud laughter of the
surrounding multitude.
</p>
<p>
To feelings naturally warm and irritable, these vociferations of
amusement and delight at their defeat, served but to exasperate and
enrage; and the Irishmen in strong terms expressed their indignation
at the merriment which their abortive attempts appeared to excite:
at length, one of the <i>Paddies</i> having cut a piece of wood, as he
conceived, sufficient to stop the effusion of water, with some degree
of adroitness thrust his arm into the foaming fluid, and for a moment
appeared to have arrested its progress.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Blood-an-owns!</i> Murphy," cried he, "scoop away the water, and be
after handing over the mallet this way." In a moment the spades of his
comrades were seen in

</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>action to accomplish his instructions, while one, who was not in a
humour to hear the taunts of the crowd, very politely scoop'd the water
with his hands among the spectators, which created a general desire
to avoid his liberal and plentiful besprinklings, and at the same time
considerable confusion among men, women, and children, who, in effecting
their escape, were seen tumbling and rolling over each other in all
directions.
</p>
<p>
"Be off wid you all, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to you," said the Hibernian; while
those who were fortunate enough to escape the cooling fluid he was
so indifferently dispensing, laughed heartily at their less favoured
companions.
</p>
<p>
Bob was for moving onward.
</p>
<p>
"Hold," said Dash all, "it is two to one but you will see some fun
here."
</p>
<p>
He had scarcely said the word, when a brawny Porter in a fustian jacket,
with his knot slung across his shoulder, manifested dislike to the
manner in which the Irish <i>jontleman</i> was pursuing his amusement.
</p>
<p>
"D&mdash;&mdash;n your Irish eyes," said he, "don't throw your water here, or
I'll lend you my <i>bunch of fives</i>." {l}
</p>
<p>
"Be after being off, there," replied Pat; and, without hesitation,
continued his employment.
</p>
<p>
The Porter was resolute, and upon receiving an additional salute, jumped
over the railings, and re-saluted poor Pat with a <i>muzzier</i>,{2} which
drew his claret in a moment. The Irishman endeavoured to rally, while
the crowd cheered the Porter and hooted the Labourer. This was the
signal for hostilities. The man who had plugg'd up the broken pipe let
go his hold, and the fountain was playing away as briskly as ever&mdash;all
was confusion, and the neighbourhood in alarm. The workmen, with spades
and pick-axes, gathered round their comrade, and there was reason to
apprehend serious mischief would occur; one of them hit the Porter with
his spade, and several others were prepared to follow his example; while
a second, who seem'd a little more blood-thirsty than the rest, raised
his pickaxe in a menacing attitude; upon perceiving which, Dashall
jump'd over the rail and
</p>
<pre>
     1 Bunch of fives&mdash;A flash term for the fist, frequently made
     use of among the lads of the Fancy, who address each other
     some-times in a friendly way, with&mdash;Ha, Bill, how goes it?&mdash;
     tip us your bunch of fives, my boy.

     2 Muzzier&mdash;A blow on the mouth.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>arrested his arm, or, if the blow had been struck, murder must
have ensued. In the mean time, several other persons, following Tom's
example, had disarmed the remainder. A fellow-labourer, who had been
engaged at a short distance, from the immediate scene of action,
attacked the man who had raised the pickaxe, between whom a pugilistic
encounter took place, the former swearing, 'By Jasus, they were a set
of cowardly rascals, and deserved <i>quilting</i>.'{1} The water was flowing
copiously&mdash;shovels, pickaxes, barrows, lanterns and other implements
were strewed around them&mdash;the crowd increased&mdash;Tom left the combatants
(when he conceived no real danger of unfair advantage being taken was to
be apprehended) to enjoy their rolling in the mud; while the Porter,
who had escaped the vengeance of his opponents, was explaining to
those around him, and expostulating with the first aggressor, upon
the impropriety of his conduct. The shouts of the multitude at the
courageous proceedings of the Porter, and the hootings at the shameful
and cowardly manner of defence pursued by the Labourers, roused
the blood of the Irishmen, and one again seized a spade to attack a
Coal-heaver who espoused the cause of the Porter&mdash;a disposition was
again manifested to cut down any one who dared to entertain opinions
opposite to their own&mdash;immediately a shower of mud and stones was
directed towards him&mdash;the spade was taken away, and the Irishmen armed
themselves in a similar way with the largest stones they could find
suitable for throwing. In this state of things, the houses and the
windows in the neighbourhood were threatened with serious damage. The
crowd retreated hallooing, shouting, hissing, and groaning; and in this
part of the affray Bob got himself well bespattered with mud. Tom again
interfered, and after a few minutes, persuaded the multitude to desist,
and the Irishmen to drop their weapons. The Porter made his escape, and
the men resumed their work; but, upon Dashall's return to the

     set-to is equally productive of heat; whether the allusion
     holds good with respect to comfort, must be left to the
     decision of those who try it on, (which is to make any
     attempt or essay where success is doubtful.)

was however quickly relieved from suspense.

"Sir," said a stout man, "the neighbourhood is greatly indebted to
your exertions in suppressing a riot from which much mischief was to be
apprehended&mdash;your friend is close at hand, if you will step this way,
you will find him&mdash;he is getting his coat brushed at my house, and has
sustained no injury."
</p>
<p>
"It is a lucky circumstance for him," said Tom: "and I think
myself fortunate upon the same account, for I assure you I was
very apprehensive of some serious mischief resulting from the
disturbance."<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>

    CHAPTER XVI
</h2>
<pre>
          "Blest be the pencil which from death can save
          The semblance of the virtuous, wise and brave,
          That youth and emulation still may gaze
          On those inspiring forms of ancient days,
          And, from the force of bright example bold,
          Rival their worth, and be what they behold."

          ".....I admire,
          None more admires the painter's magic skill,
          Who shews me that which I shall never see,
          Conveys a distant country into mine,
          And throws Italian light on British walls."
</pre>
<p>
AS they entered the house, a few doors up Newman Street, Tallyho met
them, having divested himself of the mud which had been thrown upon his
garments by the indiscriminating hand of an enraged multitude; and after
politely thanking the gentleman for his friendly accommodation, they
were about to proceed to the place of their original destination; when
Dashall, perceiving an elegantly dressed lady on the opposite side of
the way, felt, instinctively as it were, for the usual appendage of a
modern fashionable, the quizzing-glass; in the performance of this he
was subjected to a double disappointment, for his rencontre with the
Hibernians had shivered the fragile ornament to atoms in his pocket,
and before he could draw forth the useless fragments, the more important
object of his attention was beyond the power of his visual orbs.
</p>
<p>
"It might have been worse," said he, as he survey'd the broken bauble:
"it is a loss which can easily be repaired, and if in losing that,
I have prevented more serious mischief, there is at least some
consolation. Apropos, here is the very place for supplying the defect
without loss of time. Dixon," {1} continued he, looking at

     profession entitle him to the patronage of the public,
     without pretending to second sight, or the powers that are
     so frequently attributed to the seventh son of a seventh
     son, has thrown some new lights upon the world. Although he
     does not pretend to make "Helps to Read," his establishment
     at No. 93, Newman Street, Oxford Road, of upwards of thirty
     years' standing, is deservedly celebrated for glasses suited
     to all sights, manufactured upon principles derived from
     long study and practical experience. Indeed, if we are to-
     place any reliance on his Advertisements, he has brought
     them to a state of perfection never before attained, and not
     to be surpassed.

advertisements in the papers, and have no doubt I may be suited here to

</p>
<p>
Upon saying this, they entered the house, and found the improver of
spectacles and eye-glasses surrounded with the articles of his trade,
who, in a moment, recognized Tom as the chief instrument in quelling the
tumult, and added his acknowledgments to what had already been offered
for his successful exertions, assuring him at the same time, that as he
considered sight to be one of the most invaluable blessings "bestowed
on mankind, he had for many years devoted the whole of his time and
attention to the improvement of glasses&mdash;put into his hand a short
treatise on the subject, and on the important assistance which may be
afforded by a judicious selection of spectacles to naturally imperfect
or overstrained eyes. Bob, in the mean time, was amusing himself with
reading bills, pamphlets, and newspapers, which lay upon the counter.
</p>
<p>
Dashall listened with attention to his dissertation on sight,
spectacles, focusses, lens, reflection, refraction, &amp;c.; but, as he
was not defective in the particular organs alluded to, felt but little
interested on the subject; selected what he really wanted, or rather
what etiquette required, when, to their great gratification, in came
Sparkle. After the first salutations were over, the latter purchased
an opera-glass; then, in company with Tom and Bob, proceeded to Oxford
Street, and upon learning their destination, determined also to take a
peep at the Exhibition.
</p>
<p>
"Come along," said Tom, catching hold of his arm, and directing him
towards Soho Square. But Sparkle recollecting that he had appointed to
meet Miss Mortimer, her Brother, and Merry well, to accompany them to
Somerset House, and finding time had escaped with more <span class="pagenum">[233]</span>rapidity
than he expected, wished them a good morning, hoped they should meet
again in the course of the day, and departed.
</p>
<p>
"You see," said Tom, "Sparkle is fully engaged in the business of love;
Miss Mortimer claims all his attention for the present."
</p>
<p>
"You appear to be very envious of his enjoyments," replied Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Not so, indeed," continued Tom; "I am only regretting that other
pursuits have estranged him from our company."
</p>
<p>
On entering the Exhibition at Soho, Tom, whose well-known taste for
science and art, and particularly for the productions of the pencil and
graver, had already rendered him conspicuous among those who knew him,
made the following remarks: "I am really glad," said he, "to find that
the eminent engravers of our country have at length adopted a method of
bringing at one view before the public, a delineation of the progress
made by our artists in a branch so essentially connected with the
performance and durability of the Fine Arts. An Exhibition of this
kind is well calculated to dispel the vulgar error, that engraving is a
servile art in the scale of works of the mind, and mostly consigned to
the copyist. An Establishment of this kind has long been wanted, and is
deserving of extensive patronage."
</p>
<p>
Having secured Catalogues, they proceeded immediately to the gratifying
scene.{1} The disposition and arrangement
</p>
<pre>
     1 The major part of the 405 subjects and sets of subjects,
     consisting of about 800 prints, are of moderate size, or
     small engravings for descriptive or literary publications,
     &amp;e. They are the lesser diamonds in a valuable collection of
     jewellery, where there are but few that are not of lucid
     excellence, and worthy of glistening in the diadem of
     Apollo, or the cestus of Venus. So indeed they have, for
     here are many subjects from ancient and modern poetry, and
     other literature, and from portraits of beautiful women.
     Among the first class, the exquisitely finishing graver of
     Mr. Warren gives us many after the designs of Messrs.
     Westall, Wilkie, Smirke, Cooke, Uwins, and Corbould; as do
     the lucid gravers of Messrs. Englehart and Rhodes, the
     nicely executing hands of Messrs. Mitan, Romney, Finden,
     Robinson, &amp;c. Among the latter class, are <i>Anna Boleyn</i>, &amp;c.
     by Mr. Scriven, who marks so accurately the character of the
     objects, and of the Painter he works from, in his well
     blended dot and stroke; Mrs. Hope, by Dawe; many lovely
     women, by Mr. Reynolds; a Courtship, by Mr. Warren, from
     Terburg, in the Marquis of Stafford's Collection; two Mary
     Queen of Scots, by Messrs. Warren and Cooper.&mdash;&mdash;From
     pictures of the old and modern Masters, are capital
     Portraits of celebrated characters of former and present
     times; of Mrs. Siddons, of Cicero, M. Angelo, Parmigiano,
     Fenelon, Raleigh, A. Durer, Erasmus, Cromwell, Ben Jonson,
     Selden, Swift, Gay, Sterne, Garrick, &amp;c. of Byron,
     Bonaparte, West, Kenible, young Napoleon, of nearly all the
     English Royal Family, and many of the Nobility.

     &mdash;&mdash;Of all the charmingly engraved Landscapes of foreign
     and home Views, and of the Animal pieces, are many from
     Messrs. W. B. and G. Cooke's recent publications of The
     Coast of England, &amp;c. of Mr. Hakewell's Italy, Mr. Nash's
     Paris, Captain Batty's France, &amp;c. Mr. Neale's Vieios, many
     of Mr. Scott's and Mr. Milton's fine Animal Prints;
     exquisitely engraved Architecture by Mr. Le Keaux, Mr.
     Lowry, Mr. G. Cooke, &amp;c. Among the large Prints are the two
     last of Mr. Holloway's noble set from Raffaelle's Cartoons;
     the Battle of Leipzig, finely executed by Mr. Scott, and
     containing Portraits of those monstrous assailers of Italy
     and of the common rights of mankind, the Emperors of Austria
     and Russia; Jaques from Shakspeare, by Mr. Middiman,
     Reynolds' Infant Hercules by Mr. Ward, The Bard, by J.
     Bromley, jun. possessing the energy of the original by the
     late President Mr. West, and The Poacher detected, by Mr.
     Lupton, from Mr. Kidd's beautiful picture.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>of the plates, and the company dispersed in various parts of the
rooms, were the first objects of attention, and the whole appearance was
truly pleasing. At one end was to be seen an old Connoisseur examining
a most beautiful engraving from an excellent drawing by
Clennell{1}&mdash;-another contemplating the brilliance of Goodall in
his beautiful print of the Fountains of Neptune in the Gardens of
Versailles. Dash all, who generally took care to see all before him,
animate and inanimate, was occasionally

     1 Luke Clennell&mdash;This unfortunate artist, a native of
     Morpeth, in Northumberland, and known to the world as an
     eminent engraver on wood, as well as a painter of no
     ordinary talent, has furnished one of those cases of human
     distress and misery which calls for the sympathy and aid of
     every friend to forlorn genius. In the midst of a
     prosperous career, with fortune "both hands full," smiling
     on every side, munificently treated by the British
     Institution, employed on an important work by the Earl of
     Bridgewater (a picture of the Fête given by the City of
     London to the Allied Sovereigns,) and with no prospect but
     that delightful one of fame and independence, earned by his
     own exertions, the most dreadful affliction of life befel
     him, and insanity rooted where taste and judgment so
     conspicuously shone. The wretched artist was of necessity
     separated from his family; his young wife, the mother of his
     three infants, descended to the grave a broken-hearted
     victim, leaving the poor orphans destitute. The Print
     alluded to in this case, representing the Charge of the Life
     Guards at Waterloo in 1816, was published by subscription
     for their benefit.

<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>casting glimpses at the pictures and the sprightly females by
which they were surrounded, and drawing his Cousin to such subjects as
appeared to be most deserving of attention; among which, the fine effect
produced by Mr. W. B. Cooke stood high in his estimation, particularly
in his View of Edinburgh from Calton Hill, and Brightling Observatory in
Rose Hill&mdash;Le Keux, in his Monument, also partook of his encomiums&mdash;T.
Woolroth's Portraits, particularly that of the Duchess of Kent, claimed
attention, and was deservedly admired, as well as a smaller one of Mr.
Shalis by the same artist; indeed, the whole appeared to be selected,
combined and arranged under the direction of a master, and calculated
at once to surprise and delight. After enjoying an hour's lounge in this
agreeable company,

<p>
"Come," said Dashall, "we will repair to Somerset House, and amuse
ourselves with colours.

arter?&mdash;where is you going to?</i>"

Upon turning round, Dashall discovered it to be the exquisite Mr.
Mincingait, who, having just caught a glimpse of him, and not knowing
what to do with himself, hung as it were upon the company of Tom and his
friend, by way of killing a little time; and was displaying his person
and apparel to the greatest advantage as he pick'd his way along the
pavement, alternately picking his teeth and twirling his watch-chain.
Passing the end of Greek Street, some conversation having taken place
upon the dashing Society in which he had spent the previous evening, Tom
indulged himself in the following description of <i>How to Cut a Dash.</i>
</p>
<p>
"Dashing society," said he, "is almost every where to be found in
London: it is indeed of so much importance among the generality of town
residents, that a sacrifice of every thing that is dear and valuable is
frequently made to appearance."
</p>
<p>
"You are a quiz," said Mincingait; "but I don't mind you, so go your
length."
</p>
<p>
"Very well," continued Tom; "then by way of instruction to my friend,
I will give my ideas upon the subject, and if perchance you should find
any resemblance to yourself in the picture I am about to draw, don't
let all the world know it. If you have an inclination to cut a dash,
situation and circumstances in life have nothing to <span class="pagenum">[236]</span>do with it;
a good bold face and a stock of assurance, are the most essential
requisites. With these, you must in the first place fall upon some
method to trick a tailor (provided you have not certain qualms that will
prevent you) by getting into his debt, for much depends upon exteriors.
There is no crime in this, for you pay him if you are able&mdash;and good
clothes are very necessary for a dash; having them cut after the newest
fashion, is also very essential. Sally forth, if on a sunday morning in
quest of a companion with whom you have the night previous (at a tavern
or confectioner's) engaged to meet at the corner. After having passed
the usual compliments of the morning with him, place yourself in
a fashionable attitude, your thumbs thrust in your pantaloon's
pockets&mdash;the right foot thrown carelessly across the left, resting on
the toe, exhibits your line turned ancle, or new boot, and is certainly
a very modest attitude&mdash;your cravat finically adjusted, and tied
sufficiently tight to produce a fine full-blooming countenance: corsets
and bag pantaloons are indispensably necessary to accoutre you for the
stand. When in this trim, dilate upon the events of the times&mdash;know
but very little of domestic affairs&mdash;expatiate and criticise upon the
imperfections or charms of the passing multitude&mdash;tell a fine story to
some acquaintance who knows but little about you, and, by this means,
borrow as much money as will furnish you with a very small bamboo, or
very large cudgel; extremes are very indispensable for a good dash.
</p>
<p>
"It is extremely unbecoming for a gentleman of fashion to pay any regard
to that old superstitious ceremony of what is commonly called '<i>going to
church'</i>&mdash;or, at most, of attending more than half a day in the week.
To attend public worship more than one hour in seven days must be
very fatiguing to a person of genteel habits&mdash;besides it would be
countenancing an old established custom. In former times, a serious and
devout attention to divine service was not thought improper; but should
a gentleman of modern manners attend public worship, to discover,
according to the law of the polite, what new face of fashion appears, I
need not mention the absurdity of decent behaviour.
</p>
<p>
'What go to meeting, say?&mdash;why this the vulgar do, Yes, and it is a
custom old as Homer too! Sure, then, we folks of fashion must with this
dispense, Or differ in some way from folks of common sense.'
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>"Melodious, indeed, are the voices of ladies and gentlemen
whispering across the pews, politely inquiring after each other's
health&mdash;the hour at which they got home from their Saturday evening's
party&mdash;what gallants attended them; and what lasses they saw safe home.
How engaging the polite posture of looking on the person next you, or
in sound sleep, instead of sacred music, playing loud bass through the
nose! But to have proceeded methodically in enumerating the improvements
in manners, I ought, first, to have mentioned some of the important
advantages of staying from church until the service is half finished.
Should you attend at the usual hour of commencing service, you might
be supposed guilty of rising in the morning as early as nine or ten
o'clock, and by that means be thought shockingly ungenteel&mdash;and if
seated quietly in the pew, you might possibly remain unnoticed; but,
by thundering along the aisle in the midst of prayer or sermon, you are
pretty sure to command the attention of the audience, and obtain the
honour of being thought by some, to have been engaged in some genteel
affair the night before! Besides, it is well known that it is only the
vulgar that attend church in proper time.
</p>
<p>
"When you parade the streets, take off your hat to every gentleman's
carriage that passes; you may do the same to any pretty woman&mdash;for
if she is well bred, (you being smartly dressed) she will return the
compliment before she be able to recollect whether your's be a face she
has seen somewhere or not; those who see it, will call you a dashing
fellow. When a beggar stops you, put your hand in your pocket, and
tell him you are very sorry you have no change; this, you know, will be
strictly true, and speaking truth is always a commendable quality;&mdash;or,
if it suits you better, bid him go to the churchwarden&mdash;this you may
easily do in a dashing way. Never think of following any business or
profession,&mdash;such conduct is unworthy of a dasher. In the evening, never
walk straight along the foot-way, but go in a zigzag direction&mdash;this
will make some people believe you have been dashing down your bottle of
wine after dinner. No dasher goes home sober.
</p>
<p>
"On making your appearance in the ball-room, put your hat under your
arm: you will find an advantage in this, as it will make a stir in
the room to make way for you and your hat, and apprize them of your
entrance.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>After one or two turns around the room, if the sets are all made
up, make a stand before one of the mirrors, to adjust your cravat, hair,
&amp;c. Be sure to have your hair brushed all over the forehead, which will
give you a very ferocious appearance. If you catch a strange damsel's
eyes fixed upon you, take it for granted that you are a fascinating
fellow, and cut a prodigious dash. As soon as the first set have
finished.dancing, fix your thumbs as before-mentioned, and make a dash
through the gaping crowd in pursuit of a partner; if you are likely to
be disappointed in obtaining one with whom you are acquainted, select
the smallest child in the room; by that means, you will attract the
attention of the ladies, and secure to you the hand of a charming Miss
for the next dance. When on the floor with one of those dashing belles,
commence a <i>tête-a-tête</i> with her, and pay no attention whatever to the
figure or steps, but walk as deliberately as the music will admit (not
dropping your little chit chat) through the dance, which is considered,
undoubtedly, very graceful, and less like a mechanic or dancing-master.
The dance finished, march into the bar, and call for a glass of
blue-ruin, white-tape, or stark-naked, which is a very fashionable
liquor among the 'ton,' and if called on to pay for it, tell the
landlord you have left your purse in one of your blues at home; and that
you will recollect it at the next ball&mdash;this, you know, can be done in
a genteel way, and you will be 'all the go.' Return into the room, and
either tread upon some gentleman's toes, or give him a slight touch with
your elbow: which, if he be inclined to resent, tell him, 'pon lionour,'
you did not observe him, or, if inclined to suffer it with impunity&mdash;'
Get out of the way, fellow, d&mdash;&mdash;n you.'
</p>
<p>
On your way home, after escorting your fair inamorata to her peaceful
abode, make a few calls for the purpose of taking a little more stimulus
with some particular friends, and then return home for the night to
'steep your senses in forgetfulness.'"
</p>
<p>
"A very amusing and useful account, truly," said Bob, as his Cousin
closed his chapter of instructions How to Cut a Dash.
</p>
<p>
"It is, at least, a just and true delineation of living character."
</p>
<p>
"Not without a good portion of caricature," said Mincingait. "You
are downright scurrilous, and ought not to be tolerated in civilized
society. Sink me, if you <span class="pagenum">[239]</span>are not quite a bore, and not fit company
for a Gentleman. so I shall wish you a good morning."
</p>
<p>
Tom and Bob laughed heartily at this declaration of the Dashing Blade,
and, wishing him a pleasant walk and a safe return, they separated.
</p>
<p>
By this time they had arrived at Somerset House: it was near three
o'clock, and the Rooms exhibited a brilliant crowd of rank and fashion,
which considerably enhanced the value of its other decorations.
</p>
<p>
"I have already," said Dashall, "given you a general description of this
building, and shall therefore confine my present observations wholly to
the establishment of the Royal Academy for the encouragement of the Fine
Arts, for the cultivation of which London is now much and deservedly
distinguished; and to the progressive improvement in which we are
indebted to that Exhibition we have already witnessed. This Academy
was opened by Royal Charter in 1768; and it consists of forty members,
called Royal Academicians, twenty Associates, and six Associate
Engravers. The first President was the justly celebrated Sir Joshua
Reynolds; the second, the highly respected Benjamin West; and the
present, is Sir Thomas Lawrence.
</p>
<p>
"The Academy possesses a fine collection of casts and models, from
antique statues, &amp;c. a School of colouring, from pictures of the best
masters. Lectures are delivered by the stated Professors in their
various branches, to the Students during the winter season; prize
medals are given annually for the best academy figures and drawings
of buildings; and gold medals for historical composition in painting,
sculpture, and designs in Architecture, once in two years; which latter
are presented to the successful Artists in full assembly, accompanied
with a discourse from the President, calculated to stimulate
perseverance and exertion. Students have at all times, (except during
the regular vacations,) an opportunity of studying nature from well
chosen models, and of drawing from the antique casts.
</p>
<p>
"This Exhibition is generally opened on the first of May. The number
of works of art, consisting of paintings, sculptures, models, proof
engravings and drawings, generally exhibited, are upwards of one
thousand; and are usually visited by all the gaiety and fashion of the
Metropolis, between the hours of two and five o'clock in <span class="pagenum">[240]</span>the day.
The rooms are elegant and spacious; and I consider it at all times
a place where a shilling may be well spent, and an hour or two well
enjoyed.
</p>
<pre>
          "Some spend a life in classing grubs, and try,
          New methods to impale a butterfly;
          Or, bottled up in spirits, keep with care
          A crowd of reptiles&mdash;hideously rare;
          While others search the mouldering wrecks of time,
          And drag their stores from dust and rust and slime;
          Coins eat with canker, medals half defac'd,
          And broken tablets, never to be trac'd;
          Worm-eaten trinkets worn away of old,
          And broken pipkins form'd in antique mould;
          Huge limbless statues, busts of heads forgot,
          And paintings representing none knows what;
          Strange legends that to monstrous fables lead,
          And manuscripts that nobody can read;
          The shapeless forms from savage hands that sprung,
          And fragments of rude art, when Art was young.
          This precious lumber, labell'd, shelv'd, and cas'd,
          And with a title of Museum grac'd,
          Shews how a man may time and fortune waste,
          And die a mummy'd connoisseur of taste."

<p>
On entering the rooms, Bob was bewildered with delight; the elegance
of the company, the number and excellence of the paintings, were
attractions so numerous and splendid, as to leave him no opportunity
of decidedly fixing his attention. He was surrounded by all that
could enchant the eye and enrapture the imagination. Moving groups of
interesting females were parading the rooms with dashing partners
at their elbows, pointing out the most beautiful paintings from the
catalogues, giving the names of the artists, or describing the subjects.
Seated on one of the benches was to be seen the tired Dandy, whose
principal inducement to be present at this display of the Arts, was to
exhibit his own pretty person, and attract a little of the public gaze
by his preposterous habiliments and unmeaning countenance; to fasten
upon the first person who came within the sound of his scarcely
articulate voice with observing, "It is d&mdash;&mdash;d hot, 'pon honour&mdash;can't
stand it&mdash;very fatiguing&mdash;I wonder so many persons are let in at
once&mdash;there's no such thing as seeing, I declare, where there is such
a crowd: I must come again, that's the end of it." On another, was the
full-dressed Elegante, with her bonnet in one hand, and her catalogue
in the other, apparently intent upon examining the pictures before
<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>her, while, in fact, her grand aim was to discover whether she
herself was observed. The lounging Blood, who had left his horses at
the door, was bustling among the company with his quizzing-glass in his
hand, determined, if possible, to have a peep at every female he met,
caring as much for the Exhibition itself, as the generality of the
visitors cared for him. The Connoisseur was placing his eye occasionally
close to the paintings, or removing to short distances, right and left,
to catch them in the most judicious lights, and making remarks on his
catalogue with a pencil; and Mrs. Roundabout, from Leadenhall, who had
brought her son Dicky to see the show, as she called it, declared it was
the '<i>most finest</i> sight she ever seed, lifting up her hand and eyes at
the same time as Dicky read over the list, and charmed her by reciting
the various scraps of poetry inserted in the catalogue to elucidate
the subjects. It was altogether a source of inexpressible delight and
amusement. Tom, whose taste for the arts qualified him well for the
office of guide upon such an occasion, directed the eye of his Cousin
to the best and most masterly productions in the collection, and
whose attention was more particularly drawn to the pictures (though
occasionally devoted to the inspection of a set of well-formed features,
or a delicately turned ancle,) was much pleased to find Bob so busy in
enquiry and observation.
</p>
<p>
"We have here," said Tom, "a combination of the finest specimens in the
art of painting laid open annually for public inspection. Music, Poetry,
and Painting, have always been held in high estimation by those who
make any pretensions to an improved mind and a refined taste. In this
Exhibition the talents of the Artists in their various lines may be
fairly estimated, and the two former may almost be said to give life to
the latter, in which the three are combined. The Historian, the Poet,
and the Philosopher, have their thoughts embodied by the Painter; and
the tale so glowingly described in language by the one, is brought full
before the eye by the other; while the Portrait-painter hands down, by
the vivid touches of his pencil, the features and character of those who
by their talents have deservedly signalized themselves in society.
The face of nature is displayed in the landscape, and the force of
imagination by the judicious selector of scenes from actual life. Hence
painting is the fascinating region of enchantment. The pencil is a
magic wand; it calls up <span class="pagenum">[242]</span>to view the most extensive and variegated
scenery calculated to wake the slumbering mind to thought.
</p>
<pre>
          "&mdash;&mdash;To mark the mighty hand
          That, ever busy, wheels the silent spheres,
          Works in the secret deep; shoots steaming thence
          The fair profusion that o'erspreads the Spring;
          Flings from the sun direct the naming day;
          Feeds every creature; hurls the tempest forth;
          And as on earth this grateful change revolves.
          With transport touches all the springs of life."
</pre>
<p>
"Upon my life!" cried Bob, "we seem to have no need of Sparkle now, for
you are endeavouring to imitate him."
</p>
<p>
"Your observations maybe just, in part," replied Tom; "but I can assure
you I have no inclination to continue in the same strain. At the
same time, grave subjects, or subjects of the pencil and graver, are
deserving of serious consideration, except where the latter are engaged
in caricature."
</p>
<p>
"And that has its utility," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"To be sure it has," continued Tom&mdash;"over the human mind, wit, humour
and ridicule maintain authoritative influence. The ludicrous images
which flit before the fancy, aided by eccentric combinations, awaken
the risible powers, and throw the soul into irresistible tumults of
laughter. Who can refrain from experiencing risible emotions when
he beholds a lively representation of Don Quixote and Sancho
Pança&mdash;Hudibras and his Ralpho&mdash;merry old Falstaff shaking his fat
sides, gabbling with Mrs. Quickly, and other grotesque figures to be
found in the vast variety of human character? To lash the vices and
expose the follies of mankind, is the professed end of this species of
painting.
</p>
<pre>
          "Satire has always shone among the rest;
          And is the boldest way, if not the best,
          To tell men freely of their foulest faults."
</pre>
<p>
Objects well worthy of attention&mdash;like comedy&mdash;may degenerate, and
become subservient to licentiousness and profligacy; yet the shafts
of ridicule judiciously aimed, like a well-directed artillery, do much
execution. With what becoming severity does the bold Caricature lay
open to public censure the intrigues of subtle Politicians, the
<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>chicanery of corrupted Courts, and the flattery of cringing
Parasites! Hence satirical books and prints, under temperate
regulations, check the dissoluteness of the great. Hogarth's Harlot's
and Rake's Progress have contributed to reform the different classes of
society&mdash;nay, it has even been doubted by some, whether the Sermons of
a Tillotson ever dissuaded so efficaciously from lust, cruelty, and
intemperance, as the Prints of an Hogarth. Indeed it may with truth
be observed, that the art of Painting is one of those innocent and
delightful means of pleasure which Providence has kindly offered to
brighten the prospects of life: under due restriction, and with proper
direction, it may be rendered something more than an elegant mode of
pleasing the eye and the imagination; it may become a very powerful
auxiliary to virtue."
</p>
<p>
"I like your remarks very well," said Bob; "but there is no such
thing as paying proper attention to them at present; besides, you are
moralizing again."
</p>
<p>
"True," said Tom, "the subjects involuntarily lead me to moral
conclusions&mdash;there is a fine picture&mdash;Nature blowing Bubbles for her
Children, from the pencil of Hilton; in which is united the simplicity
of art with allegory, the seriousness of moral instruction and satire
with the charms of female and infantine beauty; the graces of form,
action, colour and beauty of parts, with those of collective groups; and
the propriety and beauty of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
He was proceeding in this strain, when, turning suddenly as he supposed
to Tallyho, he was not a little surprised and confused to find, instead
of his Cousin, the beautiful and interesting Miss Mortimer, at his
elbow, listening with close attention to his description.
</p>
<p>
"Miss Mortimer," continued he&mdash;which following immediately in connection
with his last sentence, created a buz of laughter from Sparkle,
Merrywell, and Mortimer, who were in conversation at a short distance,
and considerably increased his confusion.
</p>
<p>
"Very gallant, indeed," said Miss Mortimer, "and truly edifying. These
studies from nature appear to have peculiar charms for you, but I
apprehend your observations were not meant for my ear."
</p>
<p>
"I was certainly not aware," continued he, "how much I was honoured;
but perceiving the company you are in, I am not much astonished at
the trick, and undoubtedly <span class="pagenum">[244]</span>have a right to feel proud of the
attentions that have been paid to my observations."
</p>
<p>
By this time the party was increased by the arrival of Col. B&mdash;&mdash;, his
daughter Maria, and Lady Lovelace, who, with Sparkle's opera glass in
her hand, was alternately looking at the paintings, and gazing at the
company. Sparkle, in the mean time, was assiduous in his attentions to
Miss Mortimer, whose lively remarks and elegant person excited general
admiration.
</p>
<p>
The first greetings of such an unexpected meeting were followed by an
invitation on the part of the Colonel to Tom and Bob to dine with them
at half past six.
</p>
<p>
Tallyho excused himself upon the score of a previous engagement; and a
wink conveyed to Tom was instantly understood; he politely declined the
honour upon the same ground, evidently perceiving there was more meant
than said; and after a few more turns among the company, and a survey of
the Pictures, during which they lost the company of young Mortimer
and his friend Merry well, (at which the Ladies expressed themselves
disappointed) they, with Sparkle, assisted the females into the
Colonel's carriage, wished them a good morning, and took their way
towards Temple Bar.
</p>
<p>
"I am at a loss," said Dashall, "to guess what you meant by a prior
engagement; for my part, I confess I had engaged myself with you, and
never felt a greater inclination for a ramble in my life."
</p>
<p>
"Then," said Bob, "I'll tell you&mdash;Merry well and Mortimer had determined
to give the old Colonel and his company the slip; and I have engaged,
provided you have no objection, to dine with them at the Globe in Fleet
Street, at half past four. They are in high glee, ready and ripe for
fun, determined to beat up the eastern quarters of the town."
</p>
<p>
"An excellent intention," continued Tom, "and exactly agreeable to my
own inclinations&mdash;we'll meet them, and my life on't we shall have a
merry evening. It is now four&mdash;we will take a walk through the temple,
and then to dinner with what appetite we may&mdash;so come along. You have
heard of the Temple, situated close to the Bar, which takes its name.
It is principally occupied by Lawyers, and Law-officers, a useful and
important body of men, whose lives are devoted to the study and
practice of the law of the land, to keep peace and harmony among the
<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>individuals of society, though there are, unfortunately, too many
pretenders to legal knowledge, who prey upon the ignorant and live by
litigation{1}&mdash;such as persons who have
</p>
<pre>
     1 In a recent meeting at the Egyptian Hall, a celebrated
     Irish Barrister is reported to have said, that 'blasphemy
     was the only trade that prospered.' The assertion, like many
     others in the same speech, was certainly a bold one, and one
     which the gentleman would have found some difficulty in
     establishing. If, however, the learned gentleman had
     substituted the word law for blasphemy, he would have been
     much nearer the truth.

     Of all the evils with which this country is afflicted, that
     of an excessive passion for law is the greatest. The sum
     paid annually in taxes is nothing to that which is spent in
     litigation. Go into our courts of justice, and you will
     often see sixty or seventy lawyers at a time; follow them
     home, and you will find that they are residing in the
     fashionable parts of the town, and living in the most
     expensive manner. Look at the lists of the two houses of
     parliament, and you will find lawyers predominate in the
     House of Commons; and, in the upper house, more peers who
     owe their origin to the law, than have sprung from the army
     and navy united. There is scarcely a street of any
     respectability without an attorney, not to mention the
     numbers that are congregated in the inns of court. In London
     alone, we are told, there are nearly three thousand
     certificated attornies, and in the country they are numerous
     in proportion.

     While on the subject of lawyers, we shall add a few
     unconnected anecdotes, which will exhibit the difference
     between times past and present.

     In the Rolls of Parliament for the year 1445, there is a
     petition from two counties in England, stating that the
     number of attornies had lately increased from sixteen to
     twenty-four, whereby the peace of those counties had been
     greatly interrupted by suits. And it was prayed that it
     might be ordained, that there should only be six attornies
     for the county of Norfolk, the same number for Suffolk, and
     two for the city of Norwich.

     The profits of the law have also increased in proportion. We
     now frequently hear of gentlemen at the bar making ten or
     fifteen thousand pounds a year by their practice; and a
     solicitor in one single suit, (the trial of Warren Hastings)
     is said to have gained no less than thirty-five thousand
     pounds! How different three centuries ago, when Roper, in
     his life of Sir Thomas More, informs us, that though he was
     an advocate of the greatest eminence, and in full business,
     yet he did not by his profession make above four hundred
     pounds per annum. There is, however, a common tradition on
     the other hand, that Sir Edward Coke's gains, at the latter
     end of this century, equalled those of a modern attorney
     general; and, by Lord Bacon's works, it appears that he made
     6000L. per annum whilst in this office. Brownlow's profits,
     likewise, one of the prothonotaries during the reign of
     Queen Elizabeth, were 6000L. per annum; and he used to close
     the profits of the year with a <i>laus deo</i>; and when they
     happened to be extraordinary,&mdash;<i>maxima laus deo</i>.

     There is no person, we believe, who is acquainted with the
     important duties of the Judges, or the laborious nature of
     their office, will think that they are too amply
     remunerated; and it is not a little remarkable, that when
     law and lawyers have increased so prodigiously, the number
     of the Judges is still the same. Fortescue, in the
     dedication of his work, De Laudibus Legum Anglise, to Prince
     Edward, says that the Judges were not accustomed to sit more
     than three hours in a day; that is, from eight o'clock in
     the morning until eleven; they passed the remainder of the
     day in studying the laws, and reading the Holy Scriptures.

     Carte supposes, that the great reason for the lawyers
     pushing in shoals to become members of Parliament, arose
     from their desire to receive the wages then paid them by
     their constituents. By an act of the 5th of Henry IV.
     lawyers were excluded from Parliament, not from a contempt
     of the common law itself, but the professors of it, who, at
     this time, being auditors to men of property, received an
     annual stipend, <i>pro connlio impenso et impendendo</i>, and
     were treated as retainers. In Madox's Form. Anglican, there
     is a form of a retainer during his life, of John de Thorp,
     as counsel to the Earl of Westmoreland; and it appears by
     the Household Book of Algernon, fifth Earl of
     Northumberland, that, in the beginning of the reign of Henry
     the Eighth, there was, in that family, a regular
     establishment for two counsellors and their servants.

     A proclamation was issued on the 6th of November, in the
     twentieth year of the reign of James I. in which the voters
     for members of Parliament are directed, "not to choose
     curious and wrangling lawyers, who may seek reputation by
     stirring needless questions."

     A strong prejudice was at this time excited against lawyers.
     In Aleyn's Henry VIII. (London, 1638,) we have the following
     philippic against them:&mdash;

          "A prating lawyer, (one of those which cloud
          That honour'd science,) did their conduct take;
          He talk'd all law, and the tumultuous crowd
          Thought it had been all gospel that he spake.
          At length, these fools their common error saw,
          A lawyer on their side, but not the law."

     Pride the drayman used to say, that it would never be well
     till the lawyers' gowns, like the Scottish colours, were
     hung up in Westminster Hall.

     From Chaucer's character of the Temple Manciple, it would
     appear that the great preferment which advocates in this
     time chiefly aspired to, was to become steward to some great
     man: he says,&mdash;"

          "Of masters he had mo than thryis ten,
          That were of law expert and curious,
          Of which there were a dozen in that house,
          Worthy to ben stuards of house and londe,
          Of any lord that is in Englonde."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>been employed as clerks to Pettifoggers, who obtain permission to
sue in their names; and persons who know no more of law than what they
have learned in Abbot's Park,{1} or on board the Fleet,{2} who assume
the title of Law Agents or Accountants, and are admirably fitted for
Agents in the Insolvent Debtor's Court under the Insolvent Act, to make
out Schedules, &amp;c. Being up to all the arts and manouvres practised with
success for the liberation of themselves, they are well calculated to
become tutors of others, though they generally take care to be well paid
for it."
</p>
<p>
By this time they were entering the Temple. "This," continued Tom,
"is an immense range of buildings, stretching from Fleet-street to
the river, north and south; and from Lombard-street, Whitefriars, to
Essex-street in the Strand, east and west.
</p>
<p>
"It takes its name from its being founded by the Knights Templars in
England. The Templars were crusaders, who, about the year 1118, formed
themselves into a military body at Jerusalem, and guarded the roads
for the safety of pilgrims. In time the order became very powerful.
The Templars in Fleet-street, in the thirteenth century, frequently
entertained the King, the Pope's nuncio, foreign ambassadors, and other
great personages.
</p>
<p>
"It is now divided into two societies of students, called the Inner and
Middle Temple, and having the name of Inns of Court.
</p>
<p>
"These societies consist of Benchers, Barristers, Students, and Members.
The government is vested in the Benchers. In term time they dine in
the hall of the society, which is called keeping commons. To dine a
fortnight in each term, is deemed keeping the term; and twelve of these
terms qualify a student to be called to year of Henry the Sixth, when
Sir Walter Beauchamp, as counsel, supported the claim of precedence of
the Earl of Warwick, against the then Earl Marshal, at the bar of the
House of Lords. Mr. Roger Hunt appeared in the same capacity for the
Earl Marshal, and both advocates, in their exordium, made most humble
protestations, entreating the lord against whom they were retained, not
to take amiss what they should advance on the part of their own client.
</p>
<p>
Another point on which the lawyers of the present age differ from their
ancestors, is in their prolixity. It was reserved for modern invention
to make a trial for high treason last eight days, or to extend a speech
to nine hours duration.
</p>
<pre>
          1 Abbot's Park&mdash;The King's Bench.

          2 On board the Fleet&mdash;The Fleet Prison.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>"These societies have the following officers and servants: a
treasurer, sub-treasurer, steward, chief butler, three under-butlers,
upper and under cook, a pannierman, a gardener, two porters, two
wash-pots, and watchmen.
</p>
<p>
"The Benchers assume and exercise a power that can scarcely be
reconciled to the reason of the thing. They examine students as to their
proficiency in the knowledge of the law, and call candidates to the bar,
or reject them at pleasure, and without appeal. It is pretty well known
that students in some cases eat their way to the bar; in which there can
be no great harm, because their clients will take the liberty afterwards
of judging how far they have otherwise qualified themselves. But every
man that eats in those societies should be called, or the rejection
should be founded solely on his ignorance of the law, and should be
subject to an appeal to a higher jurisdiction; otherwise the power of
the Benchers may be exercised on private or party motives.
</p>
<p>
"The expence of going through the course of these Societies is not
great. In the Inner Temple, a student pays on admission, for the fees of
the society, 3L. 6s. 8d. which, with other customary charges, amounts to
4L 2s. A duty is also paid to the King, which is high. Terms may be kept
for about 10s. per week, and, in fact, students may dine at a cheaper
rate here than any where beside. The expences in the principal societies
of like nature are something more.
</p>
<p>
"Their kitchens, and dinner-rooms, merit the inspection of strangers,
and may be seen on applying to the porter, or cooks, without fee or
introduction. Our time is short now, or we would take a peep; you must
therefore content yourself with my description.
</p>
<p>
"The Temple is an irregular building. In Fleet-street are two entrances,
one to the Inner, and the other to the Middle Temple. The latter has a
front in the manner of Inigo Jones, of brick, ornamented with four large
stone pilastres, of the Ionic order, with a pediment. It is too narrow,
and being lofty, wants proportion. The passage to which it leads,
although designed for carriages, is narrow, inconvenient, and mean.
</p>
<p>
"The garden of the Inner Temple is not only a most happy situation, but
is laid out with great taste, and kept <span class="pagenum">[249]</span>in perfect order. It
is chiefly covered with green sward,, which is pleasing to the eye,
especially in a city, and is most agreeable to walk on. It lies, as you
perceive, along the river, is of great extent, and has a spacious
gravel walk, or terrace, on the bank of the Thames. It forms a crowded
promenade in summer, and at such times is an interesting spot.
</p>
<p>
"The Middle Temple has a garden, but much smaller,, and not so
advantageously situated.
</p>
<p>
"The hall of the Middle Temple is a spacious and elegant room in its
style. Many great feasts have been given in it in old times. It is well
worth a visit.
</p>
<p>
"The Inner Temple hall is comparatively small, but is a fine room. It is
ornamented with the portraits of several of the Judges. Before this
hall is a broad paved terrace, forming an excellent promenade, when the
gardens are not sufficiently dry.
</p>
<p>
"There are two good libraries belonging to these societies, open to
students, and to others on application to the librarian, from ten in the
morning till one, and in the afternoon from two till six.
</p>
<p>
"The Temple church belongs in common to the two societies. The Knights
Templars built their church on this site, which was destroyed, and the
present edifice was erected by the Knights Hospitallers. It is in the
Norman style of architecture, and has three aisles, running east and
west, and two cross aisles. At the western end is a spacious round
tower, the inside of which forms an elegant and singular entrance into
the church, from which it is not separated by close walls, but merely by
arches. The whole edifice within has an uncommon and noble aspect. The
roof of the church is supported by slight pillars of Sussex marble, and
there are three windows at each side, adorned with small pillars of the
same marble. The entire floor is of flags of black and white marble;
the roof of the tower is supported with six pillars, having an upper and
lower range of small arches, except on the eastern side, opening into
the church: The length of the church is eighty-three feet; the breadth
sixty; and the height thirty-four; the height of the inside of the tower
is forty-eight feet, and its diameter on the floor fifty-one.
</p>
<p>
"In the porch or tower are the tombs of eleven Knights Templars; eight
of them have the figures of <span class="pagenum">[250]</span>armed knights on them, three of them
being the tombs of so many Earls of Pembroke. The organ of this church
is one of the finest in the world.
</p>
<p>
"The Temple church is open for divine service every day, at eleven
o'clock in the morning, and at four in the afternoon. There are four
entrances into the Temple, besides those in Fleet-street; and it is
a thoroughfare during the day, but the gates are shut at night. The
gardens are open to the public in summer. It is a place of much business
and constant traffic, I assure you."
</p>
<p>
"I perceive it," said Bob, "by the number of persons passing and
repassing, every one apparently animated and impelled by some business
of importance."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, it is something like a steam-boiler, by which a considerable
portion of the engines of the Law are kept in motion. They can alarm and
allay according to the pockets of their customers, or the sagacity which
they are able to discover in their heads. There are perhaps as many
Quacks in this profession as in any other," continued Tom, as they
regained Fleet-street; when, perceiving it was half past four o'clock by
St. Dunstan's&mdash;"But we must now make the best of our way, or we may be
cut out of the good things of this <i>Globe</i>."
</p>
<p>
"What are so many persons collected together here for?" enquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Merely to witness a little of ingenious machinery. Keep your eye on the
two figures in the front of the church with clubs in their hands."
</p>
<p>
"I do," said Bob; "but there does not appear to me to be any thing very
remarkable about them."
</p>
<p>
He scarcely uttered the words, when he observed that these figures
struck their clubs upon the bells which hung between them to denote the
time of day.
</p>
<p>
"These figures," said Tom, "and the circumstance of giving them motion
every fifteen minutes by the movements of the clock, have attracted a
great deal of notice, particularly among persons from the country, and
at almost every quarter of an hour throughout the day they are honoured
with spectators. The church itself is very ancient, and has been
recently beautified. The <i>Bell thumpers</i>, whose abilities you have just
had a specimen of, have been standing there ever since the year 1671."
</p>
<p>
"It is hard service," said Bob, "and they must certainly deserve a
pension from Government more than many of <span class="pagenum">[251]</span>the automatons who are
now in the enjoyment of the national bounties."
</p>
<p>
"You are right enough," said a Translator of Soles,{1} who had overheard
Bob's last remark, with a pair of old shoes under his arm; "and d&mdash;&mdash;n
me if I would give a pair of <i>crazy crabshells</i>{2} without <i>vamp or
whelt for the whole boiling of 'em</i>{3}-there is not one on 'em worth a
bloody jemmy."{4}
</p>
<p>
Upon hearing this from the political Cobbler, a disturbed sort of shout
was uttered by the surrounding spectators, who had rather increased than
diminished in number, to hear the observations of the leathern-lung'd
Orator; when Tom, giving his Cousin a significant pinch of the arm,
impelled him forward, and left them to the enjoyment of their humour.
</p>
<p>
"Political observations are always bad in the street," said Tom; "it is
a subject upon which scarcely any two persons agree distinctly-<i>Old Wax
and Bristles</i> is about <i>three sheets in the wind</i>,{5} and no doubt there
are enough to take advantage of any persons stopping at this time of the
day."{6}
</p>
<p>
"What have we here?" said Bob, who observed a concourse of people
surrounding the end of Fetter Lane.
</p>
<p>
"Only a couple more of striking figures," replied Tom, "almost as
intelligent as those we have just seen."
</p>
<pre>
     1  Translator of Soles&mdash;A disciple of St. Crispin, alias a
     cobbler, who can botch up old shoes, so as to have the
     appearance of being almost new, and who is principally
     engaged in his laudable occupation by the second-hand shoe-
     sellers of Field Lane, Turn Stile, &amp;c. for the purpose of
     turning an honest penny, i.e. to deceive poor purchasers.

     2 Crab-shells&mdash;A cant term for shoes.

     3  Whole boding of 'em&mdash;The whole kit of 'em, &amp;c. means the
     whole party.

     4 Bloody Jemmy&mdash;A cant term for a sheep's head.

     5  Three sheets in the wind&mdash;A cant phrase intending to
     explain that a person is more than half drunk.

     6 This was a hint well given by Dashall; for, in the present
     times, it is scarcely possible to be aware of the numerous
     depredations that are committed in the streets of the
     Metropolis in open day-light; and it is a well-known fact,
     that Fleet Street, being one of the leading thoroughfares,
     is at almost all times infested with loose characters of
     every description, from the well-dressed Sharpers, who hover
     round the entrances to billiard-tables to mark new comers,
     and give information to the pals in waiting, somewhere
     within call, and who are called Macers-to the wily Duffers
     or Buffers, willing to sell extraordinary bargains, and the
     <i>Cly-faker</i>, or Pickpocket.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>Bob bustled forward, and looking down the lane, perceived two
Watchmen, one on each side the street, bearing poles with black boards
inscribed in white letters, "Beware of bad houses," and a lantern
hanging to each.
</p>
<p>
"These," said Tom, "are not decoy ducks, but scare crows, at least they
are intended for such; whether their appearance does not operate as much
one way as it does the other, is, I believe, a matter of doubt."
</p>
<p>
"Beware of bad houses," said Bob&mdash;"I don't exactlY see the object."
</p>
<p>
"No, perhaps not," continued his Cousin; "but I will tell you: this is a
method which the Churchwardens of parishes sometimes take of shaming
the <i>pa-pa</i> or <i>fie fie</i> ladies from their residences, or at least of
discovering their visitors; but I am half inclined to think, that nine
times out of ten the contrary effect is produced; for these men who are
stationed as warnings to avoid, are easily to be blinded by the gay and
gallant youths, who have" an inclination to obtain an admission to
the fair cyprians; besides which, if the first inhabitants are really
induced to quit, the house is quickly occupied by similar game, and
the circumstance of the burning out, as it is termed, serves as a
direction-post to new visitors; so that no real good is eventually
effected-Come, we had better move on&mdash;there is nothing more
extraordinary here."
</p>
<p>
"This is Peele's Coffee House," continued he&mdash;"a house celebrated for
its general good accommodations. Here, as well as at the Chapter Coffee
House, in Paternoster Row, all the newspapers are kept filed annually,
and may be referred to by application to the Waiters, at the very
trifling expense of a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. The Monthly
and Quarterly Reviews, and the provincial papers, are also kept for the
accommodation of the customers, and constitute an extensive and valuable
library; it is the frequent resort of Authors and Critics, who meet to
pore over the news of the day, or search the records of past times."
</p>
<p>
"An excellent way of passing an hour," said Bob, "and a proof of the
studied attention which is paid not only to the comforts and convenience
of their customers, but also to their instruction."
</p>
<p>
"You are right," replied Tom; "in London every man has an opportunity
of living according to his wishes and <span class="pagenum">[253]</span>the powers of his pocket;
he may dive, like Roderick Random, into a cellar, and fill his belly for
four pence, or regale himself with the more exquisite delicacies of the
London Tavern at a guinea; while the moderate tradesman can be supplied
at a chop-house for a couple of shillings; and the mechanic by a call at
the shop over the way at the corner of Water Lane,{1} may purchase his
half pound of ham or beef, and retire to a public-house to eat it; where
he obtains his pint of porter, and in turn has an opportunity of reading
the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, the <i>Times</i>, or the <i>Chronicle</i>. Up this court
is a well-known house, the sign of the Old Cheshire Cheese; it has long
been established as a chop-house, and provides daily for a considerable
number of persons; but similar accommodations are to be found in almost
every street in London. Then again, there are cook-shops of a still
humbler description where a dinner may be procured at a still more
moderate price; so that in this great Metropolis there is accommodation
for all ranks and descriptions of persons, who may be served according
to the delicacy of their appetites and the state of their finances.
</p>
<p>
"A Chop-house is productive of all the pleasures in life; it is a
combination of the most agreeable and satisfactory amusements: indeed,
those who have never had an opportunity of experiencing the true
happiness therein to be found, have a large portion of delight and
gratification to discover: the heart, the mind and the constitution
are to be mended upon crossing its threshold; and description must
fall short in its efforts to pourtray its enlivening and invigorating
influence; it is, in a word, a little world within itself, absolutely
a universe in miniature, possessing a system peculiar to itself, of
planets and satellites,
</p>
<pre>
     1 This allusion was made by the Hon. Tom Dashall to the Shop
     of Mr. Cantis, who was formerly in the employ of Mr. Epps,
     and whose appearance in opposition to him at Temple Bar a
     few years back excited a great deal of public attention, and
     had the effect of reducing the prices of their ham and beef.
     Mr. Epps generally has from fourteen to twenty Shops, and
     sometimes more, situated in different parts of the
     Metropolis, and there is scarcely a street in London where
     there is not some similar place of accommodation; but Mr.
     Epps is the most extensive purveyor for the public appetite.
     At these shops, families may be supplied with any quantity,
     from an ounce to a pound, of hot boiled beef and ham at
     moderate prices; while the poor are regaled with a plate of
     cuttings at a penny or twopence each.

and fixed stars and revolutions, and its motions are annual, rotatory
and diurnal, in all its extensive diversity of waiters, cooks,
saucepans, fryingpans, gridirons, salamanders, stoves and smoke-jacks;
so that if you wish to know true and uncloying delight, you are now
acquainted with where it is to be found. Not all the sages of the
ancient or the modern world ever dreamed of a theory half so exquisite,
or calculated to afford man a treat so truly delicious.
</p>
<p>
"Within the doors of a Chop-house are to be found food for both body
and soul-mortal and mental appetites-feasting for corporeal cravings and
cravings intellectual-nourishment at once for the faculties both of mind
and body: there, in fact, the brain may be invigorated, and the mind fed
with good things; while the palate is satisfied by devouring a mutton
chop, a veal cutlet, or a beef steak; and huge draughts of wisdom may be
imbibed while drinking a bottle of soda or a pint of humble porter.
</p>
<p>
"In this delightful place of amusement and convenience, there is
provender for philosophers or fools, stoics or epicureans; contemplation
for genius of all denominations; and it embraces every species of
science and of art, (having an especial eye to the important art of
Cookery;) it encompasses all that is worthy of the sublimest faculties
and capacities of the soul; it is the resort of all that is truly good
and glorious on earth, the needy and the noble, the wealthy and the
wise. Its high estimation is universally acknowledged; it has the
suffrage of the whole world, so much so, that at all times and in all
seasons its supremacy is admitted and its influence recognized. The
name, the very name alone, is sufficient to excite all that is
pleasant to our senses (five or seven, how many soever there may be.) A
Chop-house! at that word what delightful prospects are presented to the
mind's eye-what a clashing of knives and forks and plates and pewter
pots, and rushing of footsteps and murmurings of expectant hosts enter
into our delighted ears&mdash;what gay scenes of varied beauty, and many
natured viands and viscous soups, tarts, puddings and pies, rise before
our visual nerves-what fragrant perfumes, sweet scented odours,
and grateful gales of delicate dainties stream into our olfactory
perceptions,

bask in the noon tide of its nature, the birds must forsake their pure
ether, and the piscatory dwellers in the vasty deep may spread no more
their finny sails towards their caves of coral. The fruits, the herbs,
and the other upgrowings of the habitable world, and all created things,
by one wave of the mighty wand are brought together into this their
common tomb. It is creative also of the lordliest independence of
spirit. It excites the best passions of the heart&mdash;it calls into action
every kind and generous feeling of our nature&mdash;it begets fraternal
affection and unanimity and cordiality of soul, and excellent
neighbourhood among men-it will correct antipodes, for its ministerial
effects will produce a Radical advantage-its component parts go down

"Your description," said Bob, "has already had the effect of awakening
appetite, and I feel almost as hungry as if I were just returning from a
fox-chace."
</p>
<p>
"Then," continued the Hon. Tom Dashall, "it is not only admirable as
a whole, its constituent and individual beauties are as provocative of
respect as the mass is of our veneration. From among its innumerable
excellencies&mdash;I will mention one which deserves to be held in
recollection and kept in our contemplation-what is more delightful
than a fine beef-steak?-spite of Lexicographers, there is something
of harmony even in its name, it seems to be the key-note of our best
constructed organs, (organs differing from all others, only because they
have no stops,) it circles all that is full, rich and sonorous&mdash;I do
not mean in its articulated enunciation, but in its internal
acceptation&mdash;there&mdash;there we feel all its strength and diapas, or force
and quantity."
</p>
<p>
"Admirable arrangements, indeed," said Bob. "True," continued
Tom; "and all of them comparatively comfortable, according to their
gradations ana the rank or circumstances of their customers. The Tavern
furnishes wines, &amp;c.; the Pot-house, porter, ale, and liquors suitable

<p>
"Daffy's," said Tallyho-"that is somewhat new to me, I don't recollect
hearing it before?"
</p>
<p>
"Daffy's Elixir," replied Dashall, "was a celebrated quack medicine,
formerly sold by a celebrated Doctor of that name, and recommended by
him as a cure for all diseases incident to the human frame. This Gin,
Old Tom, and Blue Ruin, are equally recommended in the present day; in
consequence of which, some of the learned gentlemen of the sporting'
world have given it the title of Daffy's, though this excellent beverage
is known by many other names.
