<h2>
    CHAPTER XVII
</h2>
<pre>
          "Here fashion and folly still go hand in hand,
          With the Blades of the East, and the Bucks of the Strand;
          The Bloods of the Park, and paraders so gay,
          Who are lounging in Bond Street the most of the day&mdash;
          Who are foremost in all that is formed for delight,
          At greeking, or wenching, or drinking all night;
          For London is circled with unceasing joys:
          Then, East, West, North and South, let us hunt them, my boys."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[258]</span> THE entrance to the house had attracted Tallyho's admiration as
they proceeded; but the taste and elegance of the Coffee-room, fitted up
with brilliant chandeliers, and presenting amidst a blaze of splendour
every comfort and accommodation for its visitors, struck him with
surprise; in which however he was not suffered to remain long, for
Merrywell and Mortimer had laid their plans with some degree of depth
and determination to carry into execution the proposed ramble of the
evening, and had ordered a private room for the party; besides which,
they had invited a friend to join them, who was introduced to Tom and
Bob, under the title of Frank Harry. Frank Harry was a humorous sort of
fellow, who could tell a tough story, sing a merry song, and was up to
snuff, though he frequently got snuffy, singing,
</p>
<pre>
          "The bottle's the Sun of our table,

          His beams are rosy wine:
          We, planets never are able

          Without his beams to shine.
          Let mirth and glee abound,

          You'll soon grow bright

          With borrow'd light,
          And shine as he goes round."
</pre>
<p>
He was also a bit of a dabbler at Poetry, a writer of Songs, Epigrams,
Epitaphs, &amp;c.; and having been a long resident in the East, was thought
to be a very useful guide on such an excursion, and proved himself a
very <span class="pagenum">[259]</span> pleasant sort of companion: he had a dawning pleasantry
in his countenance, eradiated by an eye of vivacity, which seemed to
indicate there was nothing which gave him so much gratification as a
mirth-moving jest.
</p>
<p>
"What spirits were his, what wit and what whim, Now cracking a joke, and
now breaking a limb."
</p>
<p>
Give him but food for laughter, and he would almost consider himself
furnished with food and raiment. There was however a pedantic manner
with him at times; an affectation of the clerical in his dress, which,
upon the whole, did not appear to be of the newest fashion, or improved
by wearing; yet he would not barter one wakeful jest for a hundred
sleepy sermons, or one laugh for a thousand sighs. If he ever sigh'd at
all, it was because he had been serious where he might have laugh'd;
if he had ever wept, it was because mankind had not laugh'd more and
mourn'd less. He appeared almost to be made up of contrarieties, turning
at times the most serious subjects into ridicule, and moralizing upon
the most ludicrous occurrences of life, never failing to conclude his
observations with some quaint or witty sentiment to excite risibility;
seeming at the same time to say,
</p>
<pre>
          "How I love to laugh;
          Never was a weeper;
          Care's a silly calf,
          Joy's my casket keeper."
</pre>
<p>
During dinner time he kept the table in a roar of laughter, by declaring
it was his opinion there was a kind of puppyism in pigs that they
should wear tails&mdash;calling a great coat, a spencer folio edition with
tail-pieces&mdash;Hercules, a man-midwife in a small way of business, because
he had but twelve labours&mdash;assured them he had seen a woman that morning
who had swallowed an almanac, which he explained by adding, that her
features were so carbuncled, that the red lettered days were visible on
her face&mdash;that Horace ran away from the battle of Philippi, merely to
prove that he was no lame poet&mdash;he described Critics as the door-porters
to the Temple of Fame, whose business was to see that no persons slipped
in with holes in their stockings, or paste buckles for diamond ones, but
was much in doubt whether they always performed their duty honestly&mdash;he
called the Sun the <i>Yellow-hair'd Laddie</i> <span class="pagenum">[260]</span> &mdash;and the Prince of
Darkness, the <i>Black Prince</i>&mdash;ask'd what was the difference between a
sigh-heaver and a coal-heaver; but obtaining no answer, I will tell you,
said he&mdash;The coal-heaver has a load at his back, which he can carry&mdash;but
a sigh-heaver has one at his heart, which he can not carry. He had a
whimsical knack of quoting old proverbs, and instead of saying, the
Cobbler should stick to his last, he conceived it ought to be, the
Cobbler should stick to his wax, because he thought that the more
practicable&mdash;What is bred in the bone, said he, will not come out with
the skewer; and justified his alteration by asserting it must be plain
enough to the fat-headed comprehensions of those epicurean persons who
have the magpie-propensity of prying into marrow-bones.
</p>
<p>
Dashall having remarked, in the course of conversation, that <i>necessity
has no law</i>.
</p>
<p>
He declared he was sorry for it&mdash;it was surely a pity, considering
the number of learned Clerks she might give employ to if she had&mdash;her
Chancellor (continued he) would have no sinecure of it, I judge: hearing
the petitions of her poor, broken-fortuned and bankrupt, subjects would
take up all his terms, though every term were a year, and every year
a term. Thus he united humour with seriousness, and seriousness with
humour, to the infinite amusement of those around him.
</p>
<p>
Merrywell, who was well acquainted with, and knew his humour, took
every opportunity of what is called drawing him out, and encouraging
his propensity to punning, a species of wit at which he was particularly
happy, for puns fell as thick from him as leaves from autumn bowers; and
he further entertained them with an account of the intention he had some
short time back of petitioning for the office of pun-purveyor to his
late Majesty; but that before he could write the last line&mdash;"And your
petitioner will ever pun" it was bestowed upon a Yeoman of the Guard.
Still, however, said he, I have an idea of opening business as a
pun-wright in general to his Majesty's subjects, for the sale and
diffusion of all that is valuable in that small ware of wit, and
intend to advertise&mdash;Puns upon all subjects, wholesale, retail, and for
exportation. N B. 1. An allowance will be made to Captains and Gentlemen
going to the East and West Indies&mdash;Hooks, Peakes, Pococks,{1} supplied
on
</p>
<pre>
     1 Well-known dramatic authors.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[261]</span> moderate terms&mdash;worn out sentiments and <i>clap-traps</i> will be
taken in exchange. N B. 2. May be had in a large quantity, in a great
deal box, price five acts of sterling comedy per packet, or in small
quantities, in court-plaster sized boxes, price one melodrama and
an interlude per box. N B. 3. The genuine puns are sealed with a true
Munden grin&mdash;all others are counterfeits&mdash;Long live Apollo, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The cloth being removed, the wine was introduced, and
</p>
<pre>
          "As wine whets the wit, improves its native force,
          And gives a pleasant flavour to discourse,"
</pre>
<p>
Frank Harry became more lively at each glass&mdash;"Egad!" said he, "my
intention of petitioning to be the king's punster, puts me in mind of a
story."
</p>
<p>
"Can't you sing it?" enquired Merrywell.
</p>
<p>
"The pipes want clearing out first," was the reply, "and that is a sign
I can't sing at present; but signal as it may appear, and I see some
telegraphic motions are exchanging, my intention is to shew to you all
the doubtful interpretation of signs in general."
</p>
<p>
"Let's have it then," said Tom; "but, Mr. Chairman, I remember an old
Song which concludes with this sentiment&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Tis hell upon earth to be wanting of wine."
</pre>
<p>
"The bottle is out, we must replenish."
</p>
<p>
The hint was no sooner given, than the defect was remedied; and after
another glass,
</p>
<p>
"King James VI. on his arrival in London, (said he) was waited on by
a Spanish Ambassador, a man of some erudition, but who had strangely
incorporated with his learning, a whimsical notion, that every country
ought to have a school, in which a certain order of men should be taught
to interpret signs; and that the most expert in this department ought
to be dignified with the title of Professor of Signs. If this plan were
adopted, he contended, that most of the difficulties arising from the
ambiguity of language, and the imperfect acquaintance which people of
one nation had with the tongue of another, would be done away. Signs, he
argued, arose from the dictates of nature; and, as they were the same
in every country, there could be no danger of their being misunderstood.
Full of this project, the Ambassador was <span class="pagenum">[262]</span> lamenting one day before
the King, that the nations of Europe were wholly destitute of this grand
desideratum; and he strongly recommended the establishment of a college
founded upon the simple principles he had suggested. The king, either
to humour this Quixotic foible, or to gratify his own ambition at the
expense of truth, observed, in reply, 'Why, Sir, I have a Professor
of Signs in one of the northernmost colleges in my dominions; but
the distance is, perhaps, six hundred miles, so that it will be
impracticable for you to have an interview with him.' Pleased with this
unexpected information, the Ambassador exclaimed&mdash;'If it had been six
hundred leagues, I would go to see him; and I am determined to set out
in the course of three or four days.' The King, who now perceived that
he had committed himself, endeavoured to divert him from his purpose;
but, finding this impossible, he immediately caused letters to be
written to the college, stating the case as it really stood, and desired
the Professors to get rid of the Ambassador in the best manner they were
able, without exposing their Sovereign. Disconcerted at this strange and
unexpected message, the Professors scarcely knew how to proceed. They,
however, at length, thought to put off their august visitant, by saying,
that the Professor of Signs was not at home, and that his return
would be very uncertain. Having thus fabricated the story, they made
preparations to receive the illustrious stranger, who, keeping his word,
in due time reached their abode. On his arrival, being introduced with
becoming solemnity, he began to enquire, who among them had the honour
of being Professor of Signs? He was told in reply, that neither of
them had that exalted honour; but the learned gentleman, after whom
he enquired, was gone into the Highlands, that they conceived his stay
would be considerable; but that no one among them could even conjecture
the period of his return. 'I will wait his coming,' replied the
Ambassador, 'if it be twelve months.'
</p>
<p>
"Finding him thus determined, and fearing, from the journey he had
already undertaken that he might be as good as his word, the learned
Professors had recourse to another stratagem. To this they found
themselves driven, by the apprehension that they must entertain him as
long as he chose to tarry; and in case he should unfortunately weary out
their patience, the whole affair must terminate <span class="pagenum">[263]</span> in a discovery of
the fraud. They knew a Butcher, who had been in the habit of serving the
colleges occasionally with meat. This man, they thought, with a little
instruction might serve their purpose; he was, however, blind with one
eye, but he had much drollery and impudence about him, and very well
knew how to conduct any farce to which his abilities were competent.
</p>
<p>
"On sending for Geordy, (for that was the butcher's name) they
communicated to him the tale, and instructing him in the part he was to
act, he readily undertook to become Professor of Signs, especially as he
was not to speak one word in the Ambassador's presence, on any pretence
whatever. Having made these arrangements, it was formally announced to
the Ambassador, that the Professor would be in town in the course of
a few days, when he might expect a silent interview. Pleased with
this information, the learned foreigner thought that he would put his
abilities at once to the test, by introducing into his dumb language
some subject that should be at once difficult, interesting, and
important. When the day of interview arrived, Geordy was cleaned up,
decorated with a large bushy wig, and covered over with a singular gown,
in every respect becoming his station. He was then seated in a chair
of state, in one of their large rooms, while the Ambassador and the
trembling Professors waited in an adjoining apartment.
</p>
<p>
"It was at length announced, that the learned Professor of Signs was
ready to receive his Excellency, who, on entering the room, was struck
with astonishment at his venerable and dignified appearance. As none of
the Professors would presume to enter, to witness the interview, under
a pretence of delicacy, (but, in reality, for fear that their presence
might have some effect upon the risible muscles of Geordy's countenance)
they waited with inconceivable anxiety, the result of this strange
adventure, upon which depended their own credit, that of the King, and,
in some degree, the honour of the nation.
</p>
<p>
"As this was an interview of signs, the Ambassador began with Geordy,
by holding up one of his fingers; Geordy replied, by holding up two. The
Ambassador then held up three; Geordy answered, by clenching his fist,
and looking sternly. The Ambassador then took an orange from his pocket,
and held it up; Geordy returned the compliment, by taking from his
pocket a <span class="pagenum">[264]</span> piece of a barley cake, which he exhibited in a similar
manner. The ambassador, satisfied with the vast attainments of the
learned Professor, then bowed before him with profound reverence, and
retired. On rejoining the agitated Professors, they fearfully began to
enquire what his Excellency thought of their learned brother? 'He is
a perfect miracle,' replied the Ambassador, 'his worth is not to be
purchased by the wealth of half the Indies.' 'May we presume to descend
to particulars?' returned the Professors, who now began to think
themselves somewhat out of danger. 'Gentlemen,' said the Ambassador,
'when I first entered into his presence, I held up one finger, to denote
that there is one God. He then held up two, signifying that the Father
should not be divided from the Son. I then held up three, intimating,
that I believed in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. He then clenched his
fist, and, looking sternly at me, signified, that these three are
one; and that he would defy me, either to separate them, or to make
additions. I then took out an orange from my pocket, and held it up, to
show the goodness of God, and to signify that he gives to his creatures
not only the necessaries, but even the luxuries of life. Then, to my
utter astonishment, this wonderful man took from his pocket a piece of
bread, thus assuring me, that this was the staff of life, and was to be
preferred to all the luxuries in the world. Being thus satisfied with
his proficiency and great attainments in this science, I silently
withdrew, to reflect upon what I had witnessed.' "Diverted with the
success of their stratagem, the Professors continued to entertain their
visitor, until he thought prudent to withdraw. No sooner had he retired,
than the opportunity was seized to learn from Geordy, in what manner he
had proceeded to give the Ambassador such wonderful satisfaction; they
being at a loss to conceive how he could have caught his ideas with
so much promptitude, and have replied to them with proportionable
readiness. But, that one story might not borrow any features from
the other, they concealed from Geordy all they had learned from the
Ambassador; and desiring him to begin with his relation, he proceeded in
the following manner:&mdash;'When the rascal came into the room, after gazing
at me a little, what do you think, gentlemen, that he did? He held up
one finger, as much as to say, you have only one eye. I then held up
two, to <span class="pagenum">[265]</span> let him know that my one eye was as good as both of
his. He then held up three, as much as to say, we have only three eyes
between us. This was so provoking, that I bent my fist at the scoundrel,
and had it not been for your sakes, I should certainly have risen from
the chair, pulled off my wig and gown, and taught him how to insult a
man, because he had the misfortune to lose one eye. The impudence of
the fellow, however, did not stop here; for he then pulled out an orange
from his pocket, and held it up, as much as to say, Your poor beggarly
country cannot produce this. I then pulled out a piece of good cake, and
held it up, giving him to understand, that I did not care a farthing for
his trash. Neither do I; and I only regret, that I did not thrash the
scoundrel's hide, that he might remember how he insulted me, and abused
my country.' We may learn from hence, that if there are not two ways of
telling a story, there are at least two ways of understanding Signs, and
also of interpreting them."
</p>
<p>
This story, which was told with considerable effect by their merry
companion, alternately called forth loud bursts of laughter, induced
profound silence, and particularly interested and delighted young
Mortimer and Tallyho; while Merrywell kept the glass in circulation,
insisting on <i>no day-light</i>{1} nor <i>heel-taps</i>,{2} and the lads began
to feel themselves all in high feather. Time was passing in fearless
enjoyment, and Frank Harry being called on by Merrywell for a song,
declared he had no objection to tip 'em a rum chant, provided it was
agreed that it should go round.
</p>
<p>
This proposal was instantly acceded to, a promise made that he should
not be at a loss for a good <i>coal-box</i>;{3} and after a little more
rosin, without which, he said, he could not pitch the key-note, he sung
the following<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
</p>
<pre>
                         SONG.

          Oh, London! dear London! magnanimous City,
          Say where is thy likeness again to be found?

          Here pleasures abundant, delightful and pretty,
          All whisk us and frisk us in magical round;

     1 No day-light&mdash;That is to leave no space in the glass; or,
     in other words, to take a bumper.

     2  Heel-taps&mdash;To leave no wine at the bottom.

     3 Coal-box&mdash;A very common corruption of chorus.

          Here we have all that in life can merry be,
          Looking and laughing with friends Hob and Nob,

          More frolic and fun than there's bloom on the cherry-tree,
          While we can muster a <i>Sovereign Bob</i>.
</pre>
<p>
(Spoken)&mdash;Yes, yes, London is the large world in a small compass: it
contains all the comforts and pleasures of human life&mdash;"Aye aye, (says a Bumpkin to his more accomplished
Kinsman) Ye mun brag o' yer Lunnun fare; if smoak, smother, mud, and
makeshift be the comforts and pleasures, gie me free air, health and

The quaint peculiarities of the Singer gave indescribable interest to

accompanied with Dashall and Frank Harry, the following

In the mean time, the enemy of life was making rapid strides upon them
unheeded, till Dashall reminded Merrywell of their intended visit to
the East; and that as he expected a large portion of amusement in that
quarter, he proposed a move.
</p>
<p>
They were by this time all well primed&mdash;ripe for a rumpus&mdash;bang-up for a

<pre>
          "Wand'ring with listless gait and spirits gay,

IT was a fine moonlight evening, and upon leaving the Globe, they again
found themselves in the hurry, bustle, and noise of the world. The glare
of the gas-lights, and the rattling of coaches, carts and vehicles of
various-descriptions, mingled with
</p>
<pre>
          "The busy hum of men,"
</pre>
<p>
attracted the attention of their eyes and ears, while the exhilarating
juice of the bottle had given a circulation to the blood which
enlivened imagination and invigorated fancy. Bob conceived himself in
Elysium, and Frank Harry was as frisky as a kitten. The first object
that arrested their progress was the house of Mr. Hone, whose political
Parodies, and whose trials on their account, have given him so much
celebrity. His window at the moment exhibited his recent satirical
publication entitled a Slap at Slop and the Bridge Street Gang.{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 The great wit and humour displayed in this publication
     have deservedly entitled it to rank high among the jeu
     desprit productions of this lively age&mdash;to describe it were
     impossible&mdash;to enjoy it must be to possess it; but for the
     information of such of our readers as are remote from the
     Metropolis, it may perhaps be necessary to give something
     like a key of explanation to its title. A certain learned
     Gentleman, formerly the Editor of the Times, said now to be
     the Conductor of the New Times, who has by his writings
     rendered himself obnoxious to a numerous class of readers,
     has been long known by the title of Dr. Slop; in his
     publication, denominated the mock Times, and the Slop Pail,
     he has been strenuous in his endeavours to support and
     uphold a Society said to mis-call themselves The
     Constitutional Society, but now denominated The Bridge
     Street Gang; and the publication alluded to, contains
     humorous and satirical parodies, and sketches of the usual
     contents of his Slop Pail; with a Life of the learned
     Doctor, and an account of the origin of the Gang.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[270]</span> "Here," said Tom, "we are introduced at once into a fine field
of observation. The inhabitant of this house defended himself in three
different trials for the publication of alleged impious, profane, and
scandalous libels on the Catechism, the Litany, and the Creed of St.
Athanasius, with a boldness, intrepidity, and perseverance, almost
unparalleled, as they followed in immediate succession, without even an
allowance of time for bodily rest or mental refreshment."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," continued Frank Harry, "and gained a verdict on each occasion,
notwithstanding the combined efforts of men in power, and those whose
constant practice in our Courts of Law, with learning and information at
their fingers ends, rendered his enemies fearful antagonists."
</p>
<p>
"It was a noble struggle," said Tallyho; "I remember we had accounts
of it in the country, and we did not fail to express our opinions by
subscriptions to remunerate the dauntless defender of the rights and
privileges of the British subject."

on the great merit displayed in the excellent designs of Mr. Cruikshank,
which embellish the work they had just been viewing; nor did they
discover any thing further worthy of notice, till Bob's ears were
suddenly attracted by a noise somewhat like that of a rattle, and
turning sharply round to discover from whence it came, was amused with
the sight of several small busts of great men, apparently dancing to the
music of a weaver's shuttle.{1}
</p>
<p>
"What the devil do you call this?" said he&mdash;"is it an exhibition of
wax-work, or a model academy?"
</p>

"Neither," replied Dashall; "this is no other than the shop of a
well-known dealer in stockings and nightcaps, who takes this ingenious
mode of making himself popular, and informing the passengers that

there generally is a crowd at the door, and there is little doubt but he
profits by those who are induced to gaze, as most people do in London,
if they can but entrap attention. Romanis is one of those gentlemen who
has contrived to make some noise in the world by puffing advertisements,
and the circulation of poetical handbills. He formerly kept a very small
shop for the sale of hosiery nearly opposite the East-India House, where
he supplied the Sailors after receiving their pay for a long voyage, as
well as their Doxies, with the articles in which he deals, by obtaining
permission to style himself "Hosier to the Rt. Hon. East India Company."
Since which, finding his trade increase and his purse extended, he has
extended his patriotic views of clothing the whole population of London
by opening shops in various parts, and has at almost all times two or
three depositories for

of his shops decorated with small busts; some of which being attached
to the upper movements of the machinery, and grotesquely attired in
patchwork and feathers, bend backwards and forwards with the motion of
the works, apparently to salute the spectators, and present to the idea

which may be assimilated to that of the Rattlesnake, accompanied with
sounds something like those of a dancing-master beating time to his
scholars. <span class="pagenum">[272]</span> his stock. At this moment, besides what we have just
seen, there is one in Gracechurch Street, and another in Shoreditch,
where the passengers are constantly assailed by a little boy, who stands
at the door with some bills in his hand, vociferating&mdash;Cheap, cheap."
</p>
<p>
"Then," said Bob, "wherever he resides I suppose may really be called
Cheapside?"
</p>
<p>
"With quite as much propriety," continued Ton, "as the place we are now
in; for, as the Irishman says in his song,
</p>
<pre>
          "At a place called Cheapside they sell every thing dear."
</pre>
<p>
During this conversation, Mortimer, Merrywell, and Harry were amusing
themselves by occasionally addressing the numerous Ladies who were
passing, and taking a peep at the shops&mdash;giggling with girls, or
admiring the taste and elegance displayed in the sale of fashionable and
useful articles&mdash;justled and impeded every now and then by the throng.
Approaching Bow Church, they made a dead stop for a moment.
</p>
<p>
"What a beautiful steeple!" exclaimed Bob; "I should, though no
architect, prefer this to any I have yet seen in London."
</p>
<p>
"Your remark," replied Dashall, "does credit to your taste; it is
considered the finest in the Metropolis. St. Paul's displays the grand
effort of Sir Christopher Wren; but there are many other fine specimens
of his genius to be seen in the City. His Latin Epitaph in St. Paul's
may be translated thus: 'If you seek his monument, look around you;' and
we may say of this steeple, 'If you wish a pillar to his fame, look
up.' The interior of the little church, Walbrook,{1} (St. Stephen's) is
likewise considered a
</p>
<pre>
     1 This church is perhaps unrivalled, for the beauty of the
     architecture of its interior. For harmony of proportion,
     grace, airiness, variety, and elegance, it is not to be
     surpassed. It is a small church, built in the form of a
     cross. The roof is supported by Corinthian columns, so
     disposed as to raise an idea of grandeur, which the
     dimensions of the structure do not seem to promise. Over the
     centre, at which the principal aisles cross, is a dome
     divided into compartments, the roof being partitioned in a
     similar manner, and the whole finely decorated. The effect
     of this build-ing is inexpressibly delightful; the eye at
     one glance embracing a plan full and distinct, and
     afterwards are seen a greater number of parts than the
     spectator was prepared to expect. It is known and admired on
     the Continent, as a master-piece of art. Over the altar is a
     fine painting of the martyrdom of St. Stephen, by West.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[273]</span> <i>chef d'ouvre</i> of the same artist, and serves to display the
versatility of his genius."
</p>
<p>
Instead however of looking up, Bob was looking over the way, where a
number of people, collected round a bookseller's window, had attracted
his attention.
</p>
<p>
"Apropos," cried Dashall,&mdash;"The Temple of Apollo&mdash;we should have
overlook'd a fine subject, but for your remark&mdash;yonder is Tegg's Evening
Book Auction, let us cross and see what's going on. He is a fellow of
'infinite mirth and good humour,' and many an evening have I passed at
his Auction, better amused than by a farce at the Theatre."
</p>
<p>
They now attempted to cross, but the intervening crowd of carriages,
three or four deep, and in a line as far as the eye could reach, for the
present opposed an obstacle.
</p>
<p>
"If I could think of it," said Sparkle, "I'd give you the Ode on his
Birth-day, which I once saw in MS.&mdash;it is the <i>jeu d'esprit</i> of a very
clever young Poet, and who perhaps one of these days may be better
known; but poets, like anatomical subjects, are worth but little till
dead."
</p>
<p>
"And for this reason, I suppose," says Tom, "their friends and patrons
are anxious they should rather be starved than die a natural death."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! now I have it&mdash;let us remain in the Church-yard a few minutes,
while the carriages pass, and you shall hear it."<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>

<p>
"Good!" exclaimed Bob; "but we will now endeavour to make our way
across, and take a peep at the subject of the Ode."
</p>
<p>
Finding the auction had not yet commenced, Sparkle proposed adjourning
to the Burton Coffee House in the adjacent passage, taking a nip of ale
by way of refreshment and exhilaration, and returning in half an hour.
This proposition was cordially agreed to by all, except Tallyho, whose
attention was engrossed by a large collection of Caricatures which
lay exposed in a portfolio on the table beneath the rostrum. The
irresistible broad humour of the subjects had taken fast hold of his
risible muscles, and in turning them over one after the other, he found
it difficult to part with such a rich fund of humour, and still more so
to stifle the violent emotion it excited. At length, clapping his hands
to his sides, he gave full vent to the impulse in a horse-laugh from a
pair of truly Stentorian lungs, and was by main force dragged out by his
companions.
</p>
<p>
While seated in the comfortable enjoyment of their nips of ale, Sparkle,
with his usual vivacity, began an elucidation of the subjects they
had just left. "The collection of Caricatures," said he, "which is
considered the largest in London, are mostly from the pencil of that
self-taught artist, the late George Woodward, and display not only a
genuine and original style of humour in the design, but a corresponding
and appropriate character in the dialogue, or speeches connected with
the figures. Like his contemporary in another branch of the art, George
Morland, he possessed all the eccentricity and thoughtless improvidence
so common and frequently so fatal to genius; and had not his good
fortune led him towards Bow Church, he must have suffered severe
privations, and perhaps eventually have perished of want. Here, he
always found a ready market, and a liberal price for his productions,
however rude or hasty the sketch, or whatever might be the subject of
them."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[275]</span> "As to books," continued he, "all ages, classes, and appetites,
may be here suited. The superficial dabbler in, and pretender to every
thing, will find collections, selections, beauties, flowers, gems, &amp;c.
The man of real knowledge may here purchase the elements, theory,
and practice of every art and science, in all the various forms and
dimensions, from a single volume, to the Encyclopedia at large.
The dandy may meet with plenty of pretty little foolscap volumes,
delightfully hot-pressed, and exquisitely embellished; the contents of
which will neither fatigue by the quantity, nor require the laborious
effort of thought to comprehend. The jolly <i>bon-vivant</i> and Bacchanal
will find abundance of the latest songs, toasts, and sentiments; and the
Would-be-Wit will meet with Joe Miller in such an endless variety of
new dresses, shapes, and sizes, that he may fancy he possesses all the
collected wit of ages brought down to the present moment. The young
Clerical will find sermons adapted to every local circumstance, every
rank and situation in society, and may furnish himself with a complete
stock in trade of sound orthodox divinity; while the City Epicure may
store himself with a complete library on the arts of confectionary,
cookery, &amp;c, from Apicius, to the "Glutton's Almanack." The Demagogue
may furnish himself with flaming patriotic speeches, ready cut and
dried, which he has only to learn by heart against the next Political
Dinner, and if he should not 'let the cat out,' by omitting to
substitute the name of Londonderry for Cæsar, he may pass off for a
second Brutus, and establish an equal claim to oratory with Burke, Pitt,
and Fox. The&mdash;&mdash;"

<p>
"Auction will be over," interrupted Bob, "before you get half through
your descriptive Catalogue of the Books, so finish your nip, and let us
be off."
</p>
<p>
They entered, and found the Orator hard at it, knocking down with all
the energy of a Crib, and the sprightly wit of a Sheridan. Puns, bon
mots, and repartees, flew about like crackers.
</p>
<p>
"The next lot, Gentlemen, is the Picture of London,&mdash;impossible to
possess a more useful book&mdash;impossible to say what trouble and expence
may be avoided by the possession of this little volume. When your
Country Cousins pay you a visit, what a bore, what an expence, to be
day after day leading them about&mdash;taking them up the Monument&mdash;down
the Adelphi&mdash;round St. Paul's&mdash;across the <span class="pagenum">[276]</span> Parks, through the new
Streets&mdash;along the Strand, or over the Docks, the whole of which may be
avoided at the expence of a few shillings. You have only to clap into
their pocket in the morning this invaluable little article, turn them
out for the day, and, if by good luck they should not fall into the
hands of sharpers and swindlers, your dear Coz will return safe home at
night, with his head full of wonders, and his pockets empty of cash!"

<p>
"The d&mdash;&mdash;l," whispered Bob, "he seems to know me, and what scent we are
upon."
</p>
<p>
"Aye," replied his Cousin, "he not only knows you, but he knows that
some of your cash will soon be in his pockets, and has therefore made a
dead set at you."
</p>
<p>
"Next lot, Gentlemen, is a work to which my last observation bore some
allusion; should your friends, as I then observed, fortunately escape
the snares and dangers laid by sharpers and swindlers to entrap the
unwary, you may, perchance, see them safe after their day's ramble; but
should&mdash;aye, Gentlemen, there's the rub&mdash;should they be caught by the
numerous traps and snares laid for the Johnny Raw and Greenhorn in this
great and wicked metropolis, God knows what may become of them. Now,
Gentlemen, we have a remedy for every disease&mdash;here is the London Spy
or Stranger's Guide through the Metropolis; here all the arts, frauds,
delusions, &amp;c. are exposed, and&mdash;Tom, give that Gentleman change for
his half crown, and deliver Lot 3.&mdash;As I was before observing,
Gentlemen&mdash;Turn out that young rascal who is making such a noise,
cracking nuts, that I can't hear the bidding.&mdash;Gentlemen, as I before
observed, if you will do me the favour of bidding me&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Good night, Sir," cried a younker, who had just exploded a detonating
cracker, and was making his escape through the crowd.
</p>
<p>
"The next lot, gentlemen, is the Young Man's best Companion, and as your
humble Servant is the author, he begs to decline any panegyric&mdash;modesty
forbids it&mdash;but leaves it entirely with you to appreciate its
merits&mdash;two shillings&mdash;two and six&mdash;three shillings&mdash;three and
six&mdash;four, going for four&mdash;for you, Sir, at four."
</p>
<p>
"Me, Sir! Lord bless you, I never opened my mouth!"
</p>
<p>
"Perfectly aware of that, Sir, it was quite unnecessary&mdash;I could read
your intention in your eye&mdash;and observed the muscle of the mouth, call'd
by anatomists the
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[277]</span> <i>zygomaticus major</i>, in the act of moving. I should have been
dull not to have noticed it&mdash;and rude not to have saved you the
trouble of speaking: Tom, deliver the Gentleman the lot, and take four
shillings."
</p>
<p>
"Well, Sir, I certainly feel flattered with your acute and polite
attention, and can do no less than profit by it&mdash;so hand up the
lot&mdash;cheap enough, God knows."
</p>
<p>
"And pray," said Dashall to his Cousin as they quitted, "what do you
intend doing with all your purchases? why it will require a waggon to
remove them."
</p>
<p>
"O, I shall send the whole down to Belville Hall: our friends there will
be furnished with a rare stock of entertainment during the long winter
evenings, and no present I could offer would be half so acceptable."
</p>
<p>
"Well," remarked Mortimer, "you bid away bravely, and frequently in your
eagerness advanced on yourself: at some sales you would have paid dearly
for this; but here no advantage was taken, the mistake was explained,
and the bidding declined in the most fair and honourable manner. I have
often made considerable purchases, and never yet had reason to repent,
which is saying much; for if I inadvertently bid for, and had a lot
knocked down to me, which I afterwards disliked, I always found an
acquaintance glad to take it off my hands at the cost, and in several
instances have sold or exchanged to considerable advantage. One thing I
am sorry we overlooked: a paper entitled, "Seven Reasons," is generally
distributed during the Sale, and more cogent reasons I assure you could
not be assigned, both for purchasing and reading in general, had the
seven wise men of Greece drawn them up. You may at any time procure a
copy, and it will furnish you with an apology for the manner in which
you have spent your time and money, for at least one hour, during your
abode in London."
</p>
<p>
Please, Sir, to buy a ha'porth of matches, said a poor, squalid little
child without a shoe to her foot, who was running by the side of
Bob&mdash;it's the last ha'porth, Sir, and I must sell them before I go home.
</p>
<p>
This address was uttered in so piteous a tone, that it could not well be
passed unheeded.
</p>
<p>
"Why," said Tallyho, "as well as Bibles and Schools for all, London
seems to have a match for every body."
</p>
<p>
"Forty a penny, Spring-radishes," said a lusty bawling <span class="pagenum">[278]</span> fellow as
he passed, in a voice so loud and strong, as to form a complete contrast
to the little ragged Petitioner, 'who held out her handful of matches
continuing her solicitations. Bob put his hand in his pocket, and gave
her sixpence.
</p>
<p>
"We shall never get on at this rate," said Tom; "and I find I must again
advise you not to believe all you hear and see. These little ragged
run-abouts are taught by their Parents a species of imposition or
deception of which you are not aware, and while perhaps you congratulate
yourself with 'the thought of having done a good act, you are only
contributing to the idleness and dissipation of a set of hardened
beings, who are laughing at your credulity; and I suspect this is a case
in point&mdash;do you see that woman on the opposite side of the way, and the
child giving her the money?"
</p>
<p>
"I do," said Tallyho; "that, I suppose, is her mother?"
</p>
<p>
"Probably," continued Dashall&mdash;"now mark what will follow."
</p>
<p>
They stopped a short time, and observed that the Child very soon
disposed of her last bunch of matches, as she had termed them, gave the
money to the woman, who supplied her in return with another last bunch,
to be disposed of in a similar way.
</p>
<p>
"Is it possible?" said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Not only possible, but you see it is actual; it is not however the only
species of deceit practised with success in London in a similar way;
indeed the trade of match-making has latterly been a good one among
those who have been willing to engage in it. Many persons of decent
appearance, representing themselves to be tradesmen and mechanics out
of employ, have placed themselves at the corners of our streets, and
canvassed the outskirts of the town, with green bags, carrying matches,
which, by telling a pityful tale, they induce housekeepers and others,
who commiserate their situation, to purchase; and, in the evening, are
able to figure away in silk stockings with the produce of their labours.
There is one man, well known in town, who makes a very good livelihood
by bawling in a stentorian voice,
</p>
<pre>
          "Whow whow, will you buy my good matches,
          Whow whow, will you buy my good matches,
          Buy my good matches, come buy'em of me."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[279]</span> He is usually dressed in something like an old military great
coat, wears spectacles, and walks with a stick."
</p>
<p>
"And is a match for any body, match him who can,", cried Frank Harry;
"But, bless your heart, that's nothing to another set of gentry, who
have infested our streets in clean apparel, with a broom in their hands,
holding at the same time a hat to receive the contributions of the
passengers, whose benevolent donations are drawn forth without inquiry
by the appearance of the applicant."
</p>
<p>
"It must," said Tallyho, "arise from the distresses of the times."
</p>
<p>
"There may be something in that," said Tom; "but in many instances it
has arisen from the depravity of the times&mdash;to work upon the well-known
benevolent feelings of John Bull; for those who ambulate the public
streets of this overgrown and still increasing Metropolis and its
principal avenues, are continually pestered with impudent impostors, of
both sexes, soliciting charity&mdash;men and women, young and old, who get
more by their pretended distresses in one day than many industrious and
painstaking tradesmen or mechanics do in a week. All the miseries,
all the pains of life, with tears that ought to be their honest and
invariable signals, can be and are counterfeited&mdash;limbs, which enjoy the
fair proportion of nature, are distorted, to work upon humanity&mdash;fits
are feigned and wounds manufactured&mdash;rags, and other appearances of the
most squalid and abject poverty, are assumed, as the best engines of
deceit, to procure riches to the idle and debaucheries to the infamous.
Ideal objects of commiseration are undoubtedly to be met with, though
rarely to be found. It requires a being hackneyed in the ways of men, or
having at least some knowledge of the town, to be able to discriminate
the party deserving of benevolence; but
</p>
<pre>
          "A begging they will go will go,
          And a begging they will go."
</pre>
<p>
The chief cause assigned by some for the innumerable classes of
mendicants that infest our streets, is a sort of innate principle of
independence and love of liberty. However, it must be apparent that they
do not like to work, and to beg they are not ashamed; they are,
with very few exceptions, lazy and impudent. And then what <span class="pagenum">[280]</span> is
collected from the humane but deluded passengers is of course expended
at their festivals in Broad Street, St. Giles's, or some other equally
elegant and appropriate part of the town, to which we shall at an early
period pay a visit. Their impudence is intolerable; for, if refused
a contribution, they frequently follow up the denial with the vilest
execrations.
</p>
<pre>
          "To make the wretched blest,
          Private charity is best."
</pre>
<p>
"The common beggar spurns at your laws; indeed many of their arts are so
difficult of detection, that they are enabled to escape the vigilance of
the police, and with impunity insult those who do not comply with their
wishes, seeming almost to say,
</p>
<pre>
          "While I am a beggar I will rail,
          And say there is no sin but to be rich;
          And being rich, my virtue then shall be,
          To say there is no vice but beggary."
</pre>
<p>
"Begging has become so much a sort of trade, that parents have been
known to give their daughters or sons the begging of certain streets in
the metropolis as marriage portions; and some years ago some scoundrels
were in the practice of visiting the outskirts of the town in sailors'
dresses, pretending to be dumb, and producing written papers stating
that their tongues had been cut out by the Algerines, by which means
they excited compassion, and were enabled to live well."
</p>
<p>
"No doubt it is a good trade," said Merry well, "and I expected we
should have been made better acquainted with its real advantages by
Capt. Barclay, of walking and sporting celebrity, who, it was said, had
laid a wager of 1000L. that he would walk from London to Edinburgh in
the assumed character of a beggar, pay all his expences of living well
on the road, and save out of his gains fifty pounds."
</p>
<p>
"True," said Tom, "but according to the best account that can be
obtained, that report is without foundation. The establishment, however,
of the Mendicity Society{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 The frauds and impositions practised upon the public are
     so numerous, that volumes might be filled by detailing the
     arts that have been and are resorted to by mendicants; and
     the records of the Society alluded to would furnish
     instances that might almost stagger the belief of the most
     credulous. The life of the infamous Vaux exhibits numerous
     instances in which he obtained money under genteel
     professions, by going about with a petition soliciting the
     aid and assistance of the charitable and humane; and
     therefore are continually cheats who go from door to door
     collecting money for distressed families, or for charitable
     purposes. It is, however, a subject so abundant, and
     increasing by every day's observation, that we shall for the
     present dismiss it, as there will be other opportunities in
     the course of the work for going more copiously into it.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[281]</span> is calculated to discover much on this subject, and has already
brought to light many instances of depravity and deception, well
deserving the serious consideration of the public."
</p>
<p>
As they approached the end of the Poultry,&mdash;"This," said Dashall, "is
the heart of the first commercial city in the known world. On the right
is the Mansion House, the residence of the Lord Mayor for the time
being."
</p>
<p>
The moon had by this time almost withdrawn her cheering beams, and there
was every appearance, from the gathering clouds, of a shower of rain.
</p>
<p>
"It is rather a heavy looking building, from what I can see at present,"
replied Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" said Tom, "the appearance of every thing at this moment is
gloomy, let us cross."
</p>
<p>
With this, they crossed the road to Debatt's the Pastry Cook's Shop.
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!" said Tom, casting his eye upon the clock, "it is after ten; I
begin to suspect we must alter our course, and defer a view of the east
to a more favourable opportunity, and particularly as we are likely to
have an accompaniment of water."
</p>
<p>
"Never mind," said Merrywell, "we can very soon be in very comfortable
quarters; besides, a rattler is always to be had or a comfortable
lodging to be procured with an obliging bed-fellow&mdash;don't you begin to
croak before there is any occasion for it&mdash;what has time to do with us?"
</p>
<p>
"Aye aye," said Frank Harry, "don't be after damping us before we
get wet; this is the land of plenty, and there is no fear of being
lost&mdash;come along."
</p>
<p>
"On the opposite side," said Tom, addressing his Cousin, "is the Bank of
England; it is a building of large extent and immense business; you can
now only discern its exterior by the light of the lamps; it is however
a place <span class="pagenum">[282]</span> to which we must pay a visit, and take a complete survey
upon some future occasion. In the front is the Royal Exchange, the daily
resort of the Merchants and Traders of the Metropolis, to transact their
various business."
</p>
<p>
"Come," said Merry well, "I find we are all upon the right scent&mdash;Frank
Harry has promised to introduce us to a house of well known resort in
this neighbourhood&mdash;we will shelter ourselves under the staple commodity
of the country&mdash;for the Woolsack and the Woolpack, I apprehend, are
synonimous."
</p>
<p>
"Well thought of, indeed," said Dashall; "it is a house where you may
at all times be certain of good accommodation and respectable
society&mdash;besides, I have some acquaintance there of long standing, and
may probably meet with them; so have with you, my boys. The Woolpack
in Cornhill," continued he, addressing himself more particularly to
Tallyho, "is a house that has been long established, and deservedly
celebrated for its general accommodations, partaking as it does of the
triple qualifications of tavern, chop-house, and public-house. Below
stairs is a commodious room for smoking parties, and is the constant
resort of foreigners,{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 There is an anecdote related, which strongly induces a
     belief that Christian VII. while in London, visited this
     house in company with his dissipated companion, Count
     Holcke, which, as it led to the dismissal of Holcke, and the
     promotion of the afterwards unfortunate Struensée, and is
     perhaps not very generally known, we shall give here.

     One day while in London, Count Holcke and Christian vir.
     went to a well-known public-house not far from the Bank,
     which was much frequented by Dutch and Swedish Captains:
     Here they listened to the conversation of the company,
     which, as might be expected, was full of expressions of
     admiration and astonishment at the splendid festivities
     daily given in honour of Christian VII. Count Holcke, who
     spoke German in its purity, asked an old Captain what he
     thought of his King, and if he were not proud of the honours
     paid to him by the English?&mdash;"I think (said the old man
     dryly) that with such counsellors as Count Holcke, if he
     escapes destruction it will be a miracle."&mdash;' Do you know
     Count Holcke, my friend, (said the disguised courtier) as
     you speak of him thus familiarly?'&mdash;"Only by report (replied
     the Dane); but every person in Copenhagen pities the young
     Queen, attributing the coolness which the King shewed
     towards her, ere he set out on his voyage, to the malicious
     advice of Holcke." The confusion of this minion may be
     easier conceived than described; whilst the King, giving the
     Skipper a handful of ducats, bade him <i>speak the truth and
     shame the devil</i>.  As soon, however, as the King spoke in
     Danish, the Skipper knew him, and looking at him with love
     and reverence, said in a low, subdued tone of voice&mdash;"
     Forgive me, Sire, but I cannot forbear my tears to see you
     exposed to the temptations of this extensive and wicked
     Metropolis, under the pilotage of the most dissolute
     nobleman of Denmark." Upon which he retired, bowing
     profoundly to his Sovereign, and casting at Count Holcke a
     look full of defiance and reproach. Holcke's embarrassment
     was considerably increased by this, and he was visibly hurt,
     seeing the King in a manner countenanced the rudeness of the
     Skipper.

     This King, who it should seem determined to see <i>Real Life
     in London</i>, mingled in all societies, participating in their
     gaieties and follies, and by practices alike injurious to
     body and soul, abandoned himself to destructive habits,
     whose rapid progress within a couple of years left nothing
     but a shattered and debilitated hulk afflicted in the
     morning of life with all the imbecility of body and mind
     incidental to extreme old age.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[283]</span> who are particularly partial to the brown stout, which they can
obtain there in higher perfection than in any other house in London.
Brokers and others, whose business calls them to the Royal Exchange, are
also pretty constant visitors, to meet captains and traders&mdash;dispose of
different articles of merchandise&mdash;engage shipping and bind bargains&mdash;it
is a sort of under Exchange, where business and refreshment go hand in
hand with the news of the day, and the clamour of the moment; beside
which, the respectable tradesmen of the neighbourhood meet in an evening
to drive dull care away, and converse on promiscuous subjects; it is
generally a mixed company, but, being intimately connected with our
object of seeing <i>Real Life in London</i>, deserves a visit. On the first
floor is a good room for dining, where sometimes eighty persons in a
day are provided with that necessary meal in a genteel style, and at a
moderate price&mdash;besides other rooms for private parties. Above these is
perhaps one of the handsomest rooms in London, of its size, capable of
dining from eighty to a hundred persons. But you will now partake of its
accommodations, and mingle with some of its company."
</p>
<p>
By this time they had passed the Royal Exchange, and Tom was enlarging
upon the new erections lately completed; when all at once,
</p>
<p>
"Hallo," said Bob, "what is become of our party?" "All right," replied
his Cousin; "they have given us the slip without slipping from us&mdash;I
know their movements to a moment, we shall very soon be with them&mdash;this
way&mdash;this way," said he, drawing Bob into the narrow passage which leads
to the back of St. Peter's Church, Cornhill&mdash;"this is the track we must
follow."
</p>
<p>
Tallyho followed in silence till they entered the house, and were
greeted by the Landlord at the bar with a bow of welcome; passing
quickly to the right, they were saluted with immoderate volumes of
smoke, conveying to their olfactory nerves the refreshing fumes of
tobacco, and almost taking from them the power of sight, except to
observe a bright flame burning in the middle of the room. Tom darted
forward, and knowing his way well, was quickly seated by the side of
Merrywell, Mortimer, and Harry; while Tallyho was seen by those who were
invisible to him', groping his way in the same direction, amidst the
laughter of the company, occasionally interlarded with scraps which
caught his ear from a gentleman who was at the moment reading some of
the comments from the columns of the Courier, in which he made frequent
pauses and observations.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[284]</span> "Why, you can't see yourself for smoke," said one; "D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n it
how hard you tread," said another. And then a line from the Reader came
as follows&mdash;"The worthy Alderman fought his battles o'er again&mdash;Ha, ha,
ha&mdash;Who comes here 1 upon my word, Sir, I thought you had lost your way,
and tumbled into the Woolpack instead of the Skin-market.&mdash;' It is a
friend of mine, Sir.'&mdash;That's a good joke, upon my soul; not arrived
yet, why St. Martin's bells have been ringing all day; perhaps he is
only half-seas over&mdash;Don't tell me, I know better than that&mdash;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n
that paper, it ought to be burnt by&mdash;The fish are all poison'd by the
Gas-light Company&mdash;Six weeks imprisonment for stealing two dogs!&mdash;Hides
and bark&mdash;How's sugars to-day?&mdash;Stocks down indeed&mdash;Yes, Sir, and bread
up&mdash;Presto, be gone&mdash;What d'ye think of that now, eh?&mdash;Gammon, nothing
but gammon&mdash;On table at four o'clock ready dressed and&mdash;Well done, my
boy, that's prime."
</p>
<p>
These sentences were uttered from different parts of the room in
almost as great a variety of voices as there must have been subjects
of conversation; but as they fell upon the ear of Tallyho without
connection, he almost fancied himself transported to the tower of Babel
amidst the confusion of tongues.
</p>
<p>
"Beg pardon," said Tallyho, who by this time had gained a seat by his
Cousin, and was gasping like a turtle for air&mdash;"I am not used to this
travelling in the dark; but I shall be able to see presently."
</p>
<p>
"See," said Frank Harry, "who the devil wants to see more than their
friends around them? and here we are <i>at home to a peg</i>."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[285]</span> "I shall have finished in two minutes, Gentlemen," said the
Reader,{1} cocking up a red nose, that shone with resplendent lustre
between his spectacles, and then continuing to read on, only listened
to by a few of those around him, while a sort of general buz of
conversation was indistinctly heard from all quarters.
</p>
<p>
They were quickly supplied with grog and segars, and Bob, finding
himself a little better able to make use of his eyes, was throwing
his glances to every part of the room, in order to take a view of the
company: and while Tom was congratulated by those who knew him at the
<i>Round Table</i>&mdash;Merrywell and Harry were in close conversation with
Mortimer.
</p>
<p>
At a distant part of the room, one could perceive boxes containing small
parties of convivials, smoking and drinking, every one seeming to have
some business of importance to claim occasional attention, or engaged
in,
</p>
<p>
"The loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind." In one corner was a stout
swarthy-looking man, with large whiskers and of ferocious appearance,
amusing those around him with conjuring tricks, to their great
satisfaction and delight; nearly opposite the Reader of the Courier, sat
an elderly Gentleman{2} with grey hair, who heard
</p>
<pre>
     1 To those who are in the habit of visiting this room in an
     evening, the character alluded to here will immediately be
     familiar. He is a gentleman well known in the neighbourhood
     as an Auctioneer, and he has a peculiar manner of reading
     with strong emphasis certain passages, at the end of which
     he makes long pauses, laughs with inward satisfaction, and
     not infrequently infuses a degree of pleasantry in others.
     The Courier is his favourite paper, and if drawn into an
     argument, he is not to be easily subdued.

          "At arguing too each person own'd his skill,
           For e'en tho' vanquish'd, he can argue still."

     2 This gentleman, who is also well known in the room, where
     he generally smokes his pipe of an evening, is plain and
     blunt, but affable and communicative in his manners&mdash;bold in
     his assertions, and has proved himself courageous in
     defending them&mdash;asthmatic, and by some termed phlegmatic;
     but an intelligent and agreeable companion, unless thwarted
     in his argument&mdash;a stanch friend to the late Queen and the
     constitution of his country, with a desire to have the
     <i>Constitution, the whole Constitution, and nothing but the
     Constitution</i>.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[286]</span> what was passing, but said nothing; he however puffed away large
quantities of smoke at every pause of the Reader, and occasionally
grinn'd at the contents of the paper, from which. Tallyho readily
concluded that he was in direct political opposition to its sentiments.
</p>
<p>
The acquisition of new company was not lost upon to those who were
seated at the round table, and it was not long before the Hon. Tom
Dashall was informed that they hoped to have the honour of his Cousin's
name as a member; nor were they backward in conveying a similar hint
to Frank Harry, who immediately proposed his two friends, Mortimer and
Merry well; an example which was followed by Tom's proposing his Cousin.

<p>
Such respectable introductions could not fail to meet the approbation
of the Gentlemen present,&mdash;consequently they were unanimously elected
Knights of the Round Table, which was almost as quickly supplied by the
Waiter with a capacious bowl of punch, and the healths of the newmade
Members drank with three times three; when their attention was suddenly
drawn to a distant part of the room, where a sprightly Stripling, who
was seated by the swarthy Conjuror before mentioned, was singing the
following Song:
</p>

                    THE JOYS OF A MILL,

     for it,
     And determined to be up to all, go down to see the show:
     Giddy pated, hearts elated, cash and courage all to view it,

     The roads are so clogg'd, that they beggar all description now,
     With lads and lasses, prim'd and grogg'd for bang-up fun and
     glee;
     Here's carts and gigs, and knowing prigs all ready to kick up a row,
     And ev'ry one is anxious to obtain a place to see;
     Here's a noted sprig of life, who sports his tits and clumner too,
     And there is Cribb and Gully, Belcher, Oliver, and H armer too,
     With Shelton, Bitton, Turner, Hales, and all the lads to go it well,
     Who now and then, to please the Fancy, make opponents know it
     well:

     Oh! 'tis a sight, &amp;c.
     But now the fight's begun, and the Combatants are setting to,
     Silence is aloud proclaim'd by voices base and shrill;
     Facing, stopping&mdash;-fibbing, dropping&mdash;claret tapping&mdash;betting too&mdash;
     Reeling, rapping&mdash;physic napping, all to grace the mill;
     Losing, winning&mdash;horse-laugh, grinning&mdash;mind you do not glance
     away,
     Or somebody may mill your mug, and of your nob in Chancery;
     For nobs and bobs, and empty fobs, the like no tongue could ever
     tell&mdash;
     See, here's the heavy-handed Gas, and there's the mighty Non-
     pareil:

     Oh! 'tis a sight, &amp;c.
     Thus milling is the fashion grown, and ev'ry one a closer is;
     With lessons from the lads of fist to turn out quite the thing;
     True science may be learn'd where'er the fam'd Mendoza is,
     And gallantry and bottom too from Scroggins, Martin, Spring;
     For sparring now is all the rage in town, and country places
     too,
     And collar-bones and claret-mugs are often seen at races too;
     While counter-hits, and give and take, as long as strength can
     hold her seat,
     Afford the best amusement in a bit of pugilistic treat:

     Oh! 'tis a sight, &amp;c.
</pre>
<p>
While this song was singing, universal silence prevailed, but an uproar
of approbation followed, which lasted for some minutes, with a general
call of encore, which however soon subsided, and the company was again
restored to their former state of conversation; each party appearing
distinct, indulged in such observations and remarks as were most
suitable or agreeable to themselves.
</p>
<p>
Bob was highly pleased with this description of a milling match; and as
the Singer was sitting near the person who had excited a considerable
portion of his attention at intervals in watching his tricks, in some of
which great ingenuity was displayed, he asked his Cousin if he knew him.
</p>
<p>
"Know him," replied Tom, "to be sure I do; that is no other than Bitton,
a well-known pugilist, who frequently exhibits at the Fives-Court; he is
a Jew, and employs his time in giving lessons."
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!" said Mortimer, "he seems to have studied the art of
Legerdemain as well as the science of Milling."
</p>
<p>
"He is an old customer here," said a little Gentleman at the opposite
side of the table, drawing from his pocket a box of segars{1}&mdash;"Now,
Sir," continued he, "if you wish for a treat," addressing himself to
Tallyho, "allow me to select you one&mdash;there, Sir, is asgar like a
nosegay&mdash;I had it from a friend of mine who only arrived yesterday&mdash;you
don't often meet with such, I assure you."
</p>
<p>
Bob accepted the offer, and was in the act of lighting it, when Bitton
approached toward their end of the room with some cards in his hand,
from which Bob began to anticipate he would shew some tricks upon them.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he came near the table, he had his eye upon the Hon. Tom
Dashall, to whom he introduced 'himself by the presentation of a card,
which announced his benefit for the next week at the Fives-Court, when
all the prime lads of the ring had promised to exhibit.
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" said Dashall, "it will be an excellent opportunity&mdash;what, will
you take a trip that way and see the mighty men of fist?"
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart," said Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"And mine too," exclaimed Mortimer.
</p>
<p>
It was therefore quickly determined, and each of the party being
supplied with a ticket, Bitton canvassed the room for other customers,
after which he again retired to his seat.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said a smartly dressed Gentleman in a white hat, "we have heard
a song from the other end of the room, I hope we shall be able to muster
one here."
</p>
<pre>
     1 This gentleman, whose dress and appearance indicate
     something of the Dandy, is a resident in Mark Lane, and
     usually spends his evening at the Round Table, where he
     appears to pride himself upon producing the finest segars
     that can be procured, and generally affords some of his
     friends an opportunity of proving them deserving the
     recommendations with which he never fails to present them.
</pre>
<p>
This proposition was received with applause, and, upon Tom's giving a
hint, Frank Harry was called upon&mdash;the glasses were filled, a toast was
given, and the bowl was dispatched for a replenish; he then sung
the following Song, accompanied with voice, manner, and action, well
calculated to rivet attention and obtain applause:

<pre>
          PIGGISH PROPENSITIES,

          THE BUMPKIN IN TOWN.

          "A Bumpkin to London one morning in Spring,
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la,
          Took a fat pig to market, his leg in a string,
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la;
          The clown drove him forward, while piggy, good lack!
          Lik'd his old home so well, he still tried to run back&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
(Spoken)&mdash;Coome, coome (said the Bumpkin to himself,) Lunnun is the
grand mart for every thing; there they have their Auction Marts, their
Coffee Marts, and their Linen Marts: and as they are fond of a tid-bit
of country pork, I see no reason why they should not have" a Pork and
Bacon Mart&mdash;so get on (pig grunts,) I am glad to hear you have a voice
on the subject, though it seems not quite in tune with my
</p>
<pre>
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de ral la.

          It chanc'd on the road they'd a dreadful disaster,
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la;
          The grunter ran back 'twixt the legs of his master,
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la;
          The Bumpkin he came to the ground in a crack,
          And the pig, getting loose, he ran all the way back!
</pre>
<p>
(Spoken)&mdash;Hallo, (said the clown, scrambling up again, and scratching
his broken head,) to be sure I have heard of sleight-of-hand,
hocus-pocus and sich like; but by gum this here be a new manouvre
called sleight of legs; however as no boanes be broken between us, I'll
endeavour to make use on 'em once more in following the game in view: so
here goes, with a
</p>
<pre>
          Hey derry, ho derry, &amp;c.

          He set off again with his pig in a rope,

          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la,
          Reach'd London, and now for good sale 'gan to hope
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la;
          But the pig, being beat 'till his bones were quite sore.
          Turning restive, rush'd in at a brandy-shop door.
</pre>
<p>
(Spoken)&mdash;The genteeler and politer part of the world might feel a
little inclined to call this piggish behaviour; but certainly after a
long and fatiguing journey, nothing can be more refreshing than a <i>drap
of the cratur</i>; and deeming this the regular mart for the good stuff, in
he bolts, leaving his master to sing as long as he pleased&mdash;Hey derry,
he deny, &amp;c.
</p>
<pre>
          Here three snuffy Tabbies he put to the rout,

          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai lft,
          With three drams to the quartern, that moment serv'd
          out,
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la;
          The pig gave a grunt, and the clown gave a roar,
          When the whole of the party lay flat on the floor!
</pre>
<p>
(Spoken)&mdash;Yes, there they lay all of a lump; and a precious group there
was of them: The old women, well prun'd with snuff and twopenny, and
bang-up with gin and bitters&mdash;the fair ones squalled; the clown growled
like a bear with a broken head; the landlord, seeing all that could be
seen as they roll'd over each other, stared, like a stuck pig! while
this grand chorus of soft and sweet voices from the swinish multitude
was accompanied by the pig with his usual grunt, and a
</p>
<pre>
          Hey derry, ho derry, &amp;o.

          The pig soon arose, and the door open flew,

          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de ral la,
          When this scrambling group was expos'd to my view,
          Hey deny, ho derry, fal de ral la;
          He set off again, without waiting for Jack,
          And not liking London, ran all the way back!
</pre>
<p>
(Spoken)&mdash;The devil take the pig! (said the Bumpkin) he is more trouble
than enough. "The devil take you (said Miss Sukey Snuffle) for you are
the greatest hog of the two; I dare say, if the truth was known, you are
brothers."&mdash;"I declare I never was so exposed in all my life (said Miss
Delia Doldrum.) There's my beautiful bloom petticoat, that never was
rumpled before in all my life&mdash;I'm quite shock'd!"&mdash;"Never mind, (said
the landlord) nobody cares about it; tho' I confess it was a shocking
affair."&mdash;'I wish he and his pigs were in the horse-pond (continued she,
endeavouring to hide her blushes with her hand)&mdash;Oh my&mdash;oh my!'&mdash;"What?"
(said Boniface)&mdash;'Oh, my elbow! (squall'd out Miss Emilia Mumble) I am
sure I shall never get over it.'&mdash;"Oh yes you will (continued he) rise
again, cheer your spirits with another drop of old Tom, and you'll soon
be able to sing
</p>
<pre>
          Hey derry, ho derry, &amp;c.

          By mutual consent the old women all swore,

          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la,
          That the clown was a brute, and his pig was a boar,
          Hey derry, ho derry, fal de rai la;
          He paid for their liquor, but grumbled, good lack,
          Without money or pig to gang all the way back.
</pre>
<p>
(Spoken)&mdash;By gum (said he to himself, as he turn'd from the door) if the
Lunneners likes country pork, country pork doant seem to like they; and
if this be the success I'm to expect in this mighty great town in search
of the Grand Mart, I'll come no more, for I thinks as how its all a
flax; therefore I'll make myself contented to set at home in my own
chimney corner in the country, and sing
</p>
<pre>
          Hey derry, ho derry, &amp;c.
</pre>
<p>
This song had attracted the attention of almost every one in the room;
there was a spirit and vivacity in the singer, combined with a power of
abruptly changing his voice, to give effect to the different passages,
and a knowledge of music as well as of character, which gave it an
irresistible charm; and the company, who had assembled round him, at the
close signified their approbation by a universal shout of applause.
</p>
<p>
All went on well&mdash;songs, toasts and sentiments&mdash;punch, puns and
witticisms, were handed about in abundance; in the mean time, the
room began to wear an appearance of thinness, many of the boxes were
completely deserted, and the Knights of the Bound Table were no
longer surrounded by their Esquires&mdash;still the joys of the bowl were
exhilarating, and the conversation agreeable, though at times a little
more in a strain of vociferation than had been manifested at the
entrance of our party. It was no time to ask questions as to the names
and occupations of the persons by whom he was surrounded; and Bob,
plainly perceiving Frank Harry was getting into Queer Street, very
prudently declined all interrogatories for the present, making, however,
a determination within himself to know more of the house and the
company.
</p>
<p>
Mortimer also discovered symptoms of lush-logic, for though he had an
inclination to keep up the chaff, his dictionary appeared to be new
modelled, and his lingo abridged by repeated clips at his mother tongue,
by which he afforded considerable food for laughter.
</p>
<p>
Perceiving this, Tallyho thought it prudent to give his Cousin a hint,
which was immediately taken, and the party broke up.<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>

<h2>
    CHAPTER XIX
</h2>
<pre>
          "O there are swilling wights in London town
          Term'd jolly dogs&mdash;choice spirits&mdash;alias swine,
          Who pour, in midnight revel, bumpers down,
          Making their throats a thoroughfare for wine.

          These spendthrifts, who life's pleasures thus outrun,
          Dosing with head-aches till the afternoon,
          Lose half men's regular estate of Sun,
          By borrowing too largely of the Moon:

          And being Bacchi plenus&mdash;full of wine&mdash;
          Although they have a tolerable notion
          Of aiming at progressive motion,
          Tis not direct, 'tis rather serpentine."
</pre>
<p>
UPON leaving the house, it was quickly discovered that Mortimer was at
sea without a rudder or compass, but was still enabled to preserve the
true line of beauty, which is said to be in a flowing curve; Merry well
was magnanimous, Frank Harry moppy, and all of them rather muggy. Harry
was going Eastward, and the remainder of the party Westward; it was
half-past one in the morning&mdash;the weather had cleared up as their brains
had been getting foggy.
</p>
<p>
Tom proposed a rattler.
</p>
<p>
Frank Harry swore by the Bacchanalian divinity they might ride in
the rumble-tumble if they liked, but none of it for him, and began to
stammer out
</p>
<pre>
          How sweet in&mdash;the&mdash;wood-lands
          Wi&mdash;ith ii&mdash;eet hound&mdash;and horn&mdash;
          To awaken&mdash;shrill&mdash;[hiccup)&mdash;echo,
          And taste the&mdash;(hiccup)&mdash;fresh morn.
</pre>
<p>
During this time, having turned to the right on leaving the Woolpack,
instead of the left, they were pursuing their way down Gracechurch
Street, in a line with London Bridge, without discovering their mistake;
nor were <span class="pagenum">[293]</span> they aware of the situation they were in till they
reached the Monument.
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!" said Tom, "we are all wrong here."
</p>
<p>
"All right," said Merrywell&mdash;"all right, my boys&mdash;go it, my kidwhys."
</p>
<p>
Bob hearing his Cousin's exclamation, began to make enquiries.
</p>
<p>
"Never mind," said Tom, "we shall get housed presently&mdash;I have it&mdash;I
know the shop&mdash;it is but seldom I get out of the way, so come along&mdash;I
dare say we shall see some more fun yet."
</p>
<p>
Saying this, he led the way down Thames street and in a short time
introduced them to the celebrated house in Dark-House Lane, kept open
at all hours of the night for the accommodation of persons coming to
market, and going off by the Gravesend boats and packets early in the
morning.
</p>
<p>
On entering this house of nocturnal convenience, a wide field for
observation was immediately opened to the mind of Dashall: he was no
novice to the varieties of character generally to be found within its
walls; and he anticipated an opportunity of imparting considerable
information to his Cousin, though somewhat clogg'd by his companions;
being known however at the bar, he found no difficulty in providing them
with beds: which being accomplished,
</p>
<p>
"Now," said Tom, "for a new scene in Real Life. Here we are situated at
Billingsgate, on the banks of the Thames; in another hour it will be all
alive&mdash;we will refresh ourselves with coffee, and then look around us;
but while it is preparing, we will take a survey of the interior&mdash;button
up&mdash;tie a silk handkerchief round your neck, and we may perhaps escape
suspicion of being mere lookers on; by which means we shall be enabled
to mingle with the customers in the tap-room, and no doubt you will see
some rum ones."
</p>
<p>
They now entered the tap or general room, which exhibited an appearance
beyond the powers of description.
</p>
<p>
In one corner lay a Sailor fast asleep, having taken so much ballast on
board as to prevent the possibility of any longer attending to the log,
but with due precaution resting his head on a bundle which he intended
to take on board his ship with him in the morning, and apparently
well guarded by a female on each side; in another was a weather-beaten
Fisherman in a Guernsey frock and a thick <span class="pagenum">[294]</span> woollen night-cap, who,
having just arrived with a cargo of fish, was toiling away time till
the commencement of the market with a pipe and a pint, by whose side was
seated a large Newfoundland dog, whose gravity of countenance formed an
excellent contrast with that of a man who was entertaining the Fisherman
with a history of his adventures through the day, and who in return was
allowed to participate in the repeatedly filled pint&mdash;a Waterman in
his coat and badge ready for a customer&mdash;and two women, each having a
shallow basket for the purpose of supplying themselves with fish at the
first market for the next day's sale.
</p>
<p>
'Going to Gravesend, Gentlemen?' enquired the Waterman, as Tom and Bob
took their seats near him.
</p>
<p>
"No," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
"Beg pardon, Sir; thought as how you was going down, and mought want a
boat, that's all; hope no offence."
</p>
<p>
"I vas down at the Frying Pan in Brick Lane yesterday, (said the
communicative adventurer;) Snivelling Bill and Carrotty Poll was there
in rum order&mdash;you know Carrotty? Poll? so Poll, (Good health to you) you
knows how gallows lushy she gets&mdash;veil, as I vas saying, she had had a
good day vith her fish, and bang she comes back to Bill&mdash;you knows she's
rather nutty upon Bill, and according to my thinking they manages things
pretty veil together, only you see as how she is too many for him: so,
vhen she comes back, b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;tme if Bill vasn't a playing at skittles,
and hadn't sold a dab all day; howsomdever he was a vinning the lush,
so you know Bill didn't care&mdash;but, my eyes! how she did blow him up vhen
she com'd in and see'd him just a going to bowl and tip, she tipp'd him
a vollopper right across the snout vhat made the skittles dance again,
and bang goes the bowl at her sconce instead of the skittles: it vas
lucky for her it did not hit her, for if it had, I'll be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d if
ever she'd a cried Buy my live flounders any more&mdash;he vas at play vith
Sam Stripe the tailor; so the flea-catcher he jumps in between 'em,
and being a piece-botcher, he thought he could be peace-maker, but
it voudn't do, tho' he jump'd about like a parch'd pea in a
frying-pan&mdash;Poll called him Stitch louse, bid him pick up his needles
and be off&mdash;Bill vanted to get at Poll, Poll vanted to get at Bill&mdash;and
between them the poor Tailor got more stripes upon his jacket than
there is colours in a harlequin's breeches at Bartlemy Fair&mdash;Here's
good health to you&mdash;it was a <span class="pagenum">[295]</span> bodkin to a but of brandy poor Snip
didn't skip out of this here vorld into that 'are?"
</p>
<p>
"And how did they settle it?" enquired the Fisherman.
</p>
<p>
'I'll tell you all about it: I never see'd such a b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;dy lark in all
my life; poor Sam is at all times as thin as a thread-paper, and being
but the ninth part of a man, he stood no chance between a man and
a voman&mdash;Bill vas bleeding at the konk like a half-killed hog, and
Carrotty Moll, full of fire and fury, vas defending herself vith her
fish-basket&mdash;Billy vas a snivelling, Poll a stoearing, and the poor
Tailor in a funk&mdash;thinks I to myself, this here vont never do&mdash;so up
I goes to Poll&mdash;Poll, says I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;' To the devil I pitch you,' says
she&mdash;only you know I knows Poll veil enough&mdash;she tried to sneak it
over me, but she found as how I know'd better&mdash;Poll, says I, hold your
luff&mdash;give us no more patter about this here rum rig&mdash;I'll give cost
price for the fish, and you shall have the money; and while I was
bargaining with her, d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n me if Bill and the Tailor vasn't a milling
avay in good style, till Stripe's wife comes in, gives Snivelling Billy
a cross-buttock and bolted off vith her fancy, like as the song says,
The devil took the tailor
</p>
<pre>
          "Vith the broad cloth under his arm."
</pre>
<p>
I never laugh'd so in all my life; I thought I should&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>
<p>
At this moment a nod from the Landlord informed Tom his coffee was
ready, when they were ushered into the parlour.
</p>
<p>
Bob, who had during the conversation in the other room, (which had
occasionally been interrupted by the snores of the sleepy Sailor, the
giggling of the Girls who appeared to have him in charge, and a growl
from the dog,) been particularly attentive to the narration of this
adventure, remarked that there was a peculiarity of dialect introduced,
which, to a person coming out of the country, would have been wholly
unintelligible.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied Tom, "almost every trade and every calling of which the
numerous inhabitants of this overgrown town is composed, has a language
of its own, differing as widely from each other as those of provincials.
Nor is this less observable in high life, where every one seems at times
to aim at rendering himself conspicuous for some extraordinary mode of
expression. But come, I <span class="pagenum">[296]</span> perceive the morning is shedding its
rays upon us, and we shall be able to take a survey of the more general
visitors to this place of extensive utility and resort&mdash;already you may
hear the rumbling of carts in Thames Street, and the shrill voice of the
Fishwives, who are preparing for a day's work, which they will nearly
finish before two-thirds of the population leave their pillows. This
market, which is principally supplied by fishing smacks and boats coming
from the sea up the river Thames, and partly by land carriage from every
distance within the limits of England, and part of Wales, is open every
morning at day-light, and supplies the retailers for some miles round
the Metropolis. The regular shop-keepers come here in carts, to purchase
of what is called the Fish Salesman, who stands as it were between the
Fisherman who brings his cargo to market and the Retailer; but there are
innumerable hawkers of fish through the streets, who come and purchase
for themselves at first hand, particularly of mackarel, herrings,
sprats, lobsters, shrimps, flounders, soles, &amp;c. and also of cod
and salmon when in season, and at a moderate rate, composing an
heterogeneous group of persons and characters, not easily to be met with
elsewhere." "Then," said Bob, "there is a certainty of high and
exalted entertainment;&mdash;I should suppose the supply of fish is very
considerable."
</p>
<p>
"The quantity of fish consumed," replied Tom, "in London is
comparatively small, fish being excessively dear in general: and this
is perhaps the most culpable defect in the supply of the capital,
considering that the rivers of Great Britain and the seas round her
coast teem with that food.&mdash;There are on an average about 2500 cargoes
of fish, of 40 tons each, brought to Billingsgate, and about 20,000 tons
by land carriage, making a total of about 120,000 tons; and the street
venders form a sample of low life in all its situations.
</p>
<pre>
          "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In such indexes, although small
          To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
          The baby figure of the giant mass
          Of things to come at large."
</pre>
<p>
And the language you have already heard forms a part of what may be
termed Cockneyism."
</p>
<p>
"Cockneyism," said Bob, with an inquisitiveness in his countenance.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[297]</span> "Yes," continued Tom, "Cockney is universally known to be the
contemptuous appellation given to an uneducated native of London,
brought into life within the sound of Bow bell&mdash;pert and conceited,
yet truly ignorant, they generally discover themselves by their mode of
speech, notwithstanding they have frequent opportunities of hearing the
best language; the cause, I apprehend, is a carelessness of every thing
but the accumulation of money, which is considered so important with
them&mdash;that they seem at all times to be in eager pursuit of it.
</p>
<pre>
          "O Plutus, god of gold!   thine aid impart,
          Teach me to catch the money-catching art;
          Or, sly Mercurius!  pilfering god of old,
          Thy lesser mysteries at least unfold."
</pre>
<p>
You will hear these gentry frequently deliver themselves in something
like the following manner:

"A female Fruit-seller will say to a Lady Oyster-dealer&mdash;Law, my dear
Mrs. Melton, how ar you this cowld morning, Mem.?&mdash;the streets vil be

Billingsgate, and you shall have a peep at the people. By this time they
are all alive."
</p>
<p>
Bob laughed at his Cousin's specimens of cockney language, and they
sallied forth, to make further observations.
</p>
<p>
It was now a fine morning, the Sun shone with resplendent lustre upon
all around them, and danced in playful dimples on the sportive Thames;
there was however but little opportunity at the moment for them to
contemplate subjects of this sort, their eyes and ears being wholly
attracted by the passing and repassing of the persons desirous to sell
or supply themselves with fish; Thames Street was almost blocked up with
carts, and the hallooing and bawling of the different drivers, loading
or unloading, formed an occasional symphony to the <span class="pagenum">[298]</span> continual hum
of those who were moving in all directions to and from the market.
</p>
<p>
"By yer leaf" said a sturdy built fellow, sweating under a load of fish
which appeared to press him almost down&mdash;"what the devil do you stand in
the way for?"
</p>
<p>
Bob, in stepping on one side to make room for this man to pass,
unfortunately trod upon the toe of an Hibernian lady, who was bearing
away a large basket of shrimps alive, and at the same time gave her arm
so forcible a jerk with his elbow, as disengaged her hand from the load;
by which means the whole cargo was overturned smack into the bosom of a
smartly dressed youth in white ducks, who was conducting some Ladies
on board one of the Gravesend boats. The confusion that followed is
scarcely to be conceived&mdash;the agitation of Talt who at hearing the
vociferated lamentations of the Irish woman&mdash;the spluttering of the
disconcerted Dandy&mdash;the declaration of the owner of the shrimps, "that
so help her God he should pay for her property"&mdash;the loud laughter of
those around them, who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment of the whole
party&mdash;and the shrimps hopping and jumping about amid the dirt and slush
of the pavement, while the Ladies were hunting those which had fallen
into the bosom of their conductor&mdash;formed a scene altogether, which,
in spite of the confusion of his Cousin, almost convulsed the Hon. Tom
Dashall with laughter, and which served but to increase the rancour of
the owner of the shrimps, and the poor toe-suffering Irishwoman, the
execrations of the Dandy Gentleman and his Ladies, and the miseries of
poor Bob; to escape from which, he gave the Hibernian and her employer
enough to purchase plaster for the one, and a fresh cargo for the other,
and seizing Tom by the arm, dragged him away from the scene of his
misfortunes in fishery.

<p>
Their progress however was presently impeded by a sudden scream, which
appeared to come from a female, and .drew together almost all the people
on the spot, it seemed as if it had been a preconcerted signal for a
general muster, and it was quickly ascertained that fisty-cuffs were the
order of the day, by the vociferations of the spectators, and the loud
acclamations of "Go it, Poll&mdash;pitch it into her&mdash;mill her snitcher&mdash;veil
done, Sail&mdash;all pluck&mdash;game to the back-bone&mdash;peppermint her
upper-story, and grapple her knowledge-box&mdash;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n my eyes, but that
vas a good one, it <span class="pagenum">[299]</span> has altered her weather-cock and shifted her
wind&mdash;There's your dairies&mdash;stand out of the way&mdash;Upon my sole you have
overturned all my flounders&mdash;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n you and your dabbs too."
</p>
<p>
Tom and Bob took up a favourable position for observation at the corner
of a fish-stall, where they could quietly witness the combatants, and
take a general survey of the proceedings.
</p>
<p>
"Now," said Tom, "here is a lark for you, a female fight."
</p>
<p>
"Fine salmon, or cod, Gentlemen," said an elderly woman&mdash;"I wish I could
tempt you to be customers."
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Bob, "they are at it in good earnest."
</p>
<p>
"O yes," said the woman, "we always have it in real earnest, no sham&mdash;I
wish Poll may sarve her out, for Sall is a d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d saucy b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;h at
all times."
</p>
<p>
"And what have they quarrelled about?" inquired Dashall.
</p>
<p>
"Jealousy, Sir, nothing else; that there man in the night-cap, with the
red ruff round his neck, is Sail's fancy man, and he sometimes lets
her have a cargo of fish for services done and performed, you
understand&mdash;and so Sail she comes down this morning, and she finds Poll
having a phililoo with him, that's all; but I wish they would go and
have it out somewhere else, for it spoils all business&mdash;Nance, go and
get us a quartern of Jacky, that I may ax these Gentlemen to drink, for
its a cold morning, and perhaps they are not used to be up so early."
</p>
<p>
Tom saw the drift of this in a moment, and taking the hint, supplied the
needful to Nance, who was dispatched for the heart-cheering beverage,
which they could perceive was in high reputation by those around them.
The effluvia of the fish, the fumes of tobacco, and the reviving
scent of the gin-bottle, rendered their olfactory salutations truly
delightful. Nor could they escape the Fish-wife without becoming
participators in the half pint of blue ruin.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said Tom, "we will now stroll a little further, and take a
survey of the street; but first we will give a look here.
</p>
<p>
"This," said he, "is the Custom House, a splendid building recently
erected, in consequence of the old one being demolished by fire in
1814." <span class="pagenum">[300]</span> "It is, indeed," replied Bob, admiring the south front,
which is executed in Portland stone.
</p>
<p>
"Do you observe," continued Tom, "the central compartment, which
comprises what is called the Long Room, and which we will visit
presently, is quite plain, except the attic, which is elegantly
ornamented?&mdash;that alto-relievo contains allegorical representations of
the arts and sciences, as connected with and promoting the commerce
and industry of the nation&mdash;that to the west, a representation of
the costume and character of the various nations with whom we hold
intercourse in our commercial relations&mdash;in the centre, under the large
massive dial-plate, are inscribed in large bronze letters the names of
the founders and the date of its erection&mdash;the figures which support
the dial in a recumbent position are emblematical of industry and
plenty&mdash;that bold projection in the centre, gives a suitable character
to the King's warehouse, and forms an appropriate support to the
imperial arms upheld by the attributes of Ocean and Commerce."
</p>
<p>
Bob gazed with admiration and delight on this truly admirable and
extensive pile of national architecture; the gentle breeze from the
river, the occasional dash of the oar, and the activity which appeared
on board the different vessels; together with the view of London Bridge
on one side, over which he could perceive pedestrians and vehicles
of various kinds passing and repassing, and the Tower on the other,
conspired to heighten and give a most imposing effect to the scene.
</p>
<p>
"The designs," said Tallyho, "are truly creditable to the taste and
science of the architect."
</p>
<p>
"And this Quay in front, is intended to be enlarged by filling up a part
of the river; besides which, a new wall and quay are to be formed from
the Tower to Billingsgate, and numerous other improvements are projected
in the contiguous streets and lanes." "Not before it is necessary," was
the reply. "It would be impossible," continued Dashall, "to visit all
the apartments this building contains; we will however have a look
at the Long Room, and as we proceed I will endeavour to give you some
further information. We are now entering the East wing, which is a
counterpart of that on the West, having like this a grand stair-case
with a double flight of steps, which conduct to a lobby at each end
of the long room, lighted by <span class="pagenum">[301]</span> these vertical lantern-lights, the
ceilings being perforated in square compartments, and glazed. These
lobbies serve to check the great draughts of air which would otherwise
flow through the room if it opened directly from the stair-case."
</p>
<p>
They now entered the Long Room, the imposing appearance of which had its
due effect upon Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"Bless me!" cried he in a state of ecstasy, "this is a room to boast of
indeed."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied his Cousin, "there is not such another room in Europe; it
is 190 feet long by 66 wide, and proportionably high, divided into
three compartments by these eight massive pillars, from which, as you
perceive, spring the three domes, which are so richly ornamented, and
ventilated through the centre of each."
</p>
<p>
"And all of stone?" inquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Not exactly so," was the reply; "the floor (excepting the situation
of the officers and clerks) is of stone, but the walls and ceilings are
drawn out and tinted in imitation."
</p>
<p>
"And what are these antique pedestals for, merely ornaments?"
</p>
<p>
Tom was pleased at this inquiry, and with a smile of satisfaction
replied&mdash;"No, these pedestals do double duty, and are something like
what the rural poet, Goldsmith, describes in his <i>Deserted Village</i>&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "The chest contriv'd a double debt to pay,
          A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day."
</pre>
<p>
These are ornamental during the summer, but useful in the winter; they
contain fire-places completely hid from view."
</p>
<p>
"Fire-places," re-echoed Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," continued his Cousin; "the smoke, descending, passes through the
piers on each side, and by their means a sufficient warmth is at all
times kept up in the room."
</p>
<p>
"That is a capital contrivance," said Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"Then, to prevent the possibility of sustaining any serious injury from
fire, on the ground, one and two pair stories, the communication is cut
off by means of iron doors, which run on wheels in chase in the centre
of the walls, and are moved backward and forward by a windlass;
which doors are closed every evening, and would effectually prevent
a communication beyond their boundaries. Fire-proof rooms also, as
repositories for valuable books <span class="pagenum">[302]</span> and papers, are provided on each
floor, where the important documents of the establishment are deposited
every evening, and removed in trunks to the respective offices. There
are in all 121 rooms devoted to various offices. This however is the
principal: here the general business is transacted, particularly for all
foreign concerns, both inwards and outwards. The Ship Master first makes
the report of the cargo here; the entries of which, either for payment
of duties, warehousing, or subsequent exportation, are all passed with
the respective officers in this room. The business of the customs is
managed by nine Commissioners, whose jurisdiction extends over all
parts of England. We will now pass out at the west wing, adjourn to yon
Tavern, refresh and refit, and after which a further walk."
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart," said Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"What ho, Master B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;," said Dashall, saluting the Landlord as he
entered the Tavern&mdash;"How does the world wag with you?&mdash;send us some soda
water&mdash;the newspaper&mdash;let somebody clean our boots&mdash;give us pen, ink and
paper, and prepare us some breakfast with all speed, but no fish, mind
that."
</p>
<p>
The Landlord bowed assent to his honourable customer; and by the time
they were ready, their orders were complied with.
</p>
<p>
"Pray," inquired Dashall of the obliging Landlord, who came in to ask if
they were supplied with all they wished for, "did you ever recover any
thing from that dashing Blade that so obligingly ordered his dinner
here?"
</p>
<p>
"Never got a halfpenny&mdash;no no, he was not one of those sort of
gentry&mdash;nor do I ever wish to see such again in my house."
</p>
<p>
This was uttered in a tone of discontent, which evidently shewed he had
no relish for the conversation.
</p>
<p>
Dashall could not refrain from laughter; upon perceiving which, the
Landlord withdrew with a loud slam of the door, and left his customers
to enjoy their mirth.
</p>
<p>
"What are you laughing at?" cried Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Why," continued his Cousin,
</p>
<pre>
          "There was, as fame reports, in days of yore,
          At least some fifty years ago, or more,
          A pleasant wight on town&mdash;&mdash;"
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[303]</span> And there are many pleasant fellows now to be met with; but you
shall have the tale as I had it: This house has been celebrated for
furnishing excellent dinners, and the cookery of fish in particular;
consequently it has been the resort of the Bucks, the Bloods, and the
dashing Swells of the town, and I myself have been well entertained
here. It will therefore not be wondered at that its accommodations
should attract the notice of a Sharper whose name and character were
well known, but who was in person a total stranger to the unsuspecting
Landlord, whom however he did not fail to visit.
</p>
<p>
Calling one afternoon for the purpose of seeing how the land lay, in
high twig, and fashionably dressed, he was supplied with a bottle of
sherry, and requested the landlord to take a part with him&mdash;praised the
wine, talked of the celebrity of his house for fish, and gave an order
for a dinner for sixteen friends during the following week. The bait was
swallowed,
</p>
<p>
"For a little flattery is sometimes well."
</p>
<p>
'But are your wines of the first quality? (inquired the visitor;) for
good eating, you know, deserves good drinking, and without that we shall
be like fishes out of water.'&mdash;' Oh, Sir, no man in London can supply
you better than myself (was the reply;) but, if you please, you shall
select which you may like best, my stock is extensive and good.' He was
consequently invited into the cellar, and tasted from several binns,
particularly marking what he chose to conceive the best. Upon returning
to the parlour again&mdash;' Bless me, (cried he) I have had my pocket pick'd
this morning, and lost my handkerchief&mdash;can you oblige me with the loan
of one for present use? and I will send it back by one of my servants.'
</p>
<p>
'Certainly, Sir,' was the reply; and the best pocket-handkerchief was
quickly produced, with another bottle of wine, the flavour of which he
had approved while below. He then wrote a letter, which he said must be
dispatched immediately by a Ticket-porter to Albemarle Street, where
he must wait for an answer. This being done, lie desired a coach to be
called&mdash;asked the Landlord if he had any silver he could accommodate him
with, as he had occasion to go a little further, but would soon return.
This being complied with, by the Landlord giving him twenty shillings
with the expectation of receiving a <span class="pagenum">[304]</span> pound note in return,
he threw himself into the coach, wished his accommodating Host good
afternoon, promised to return in less than an hour, but has never shewn
his face here since. Poor B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;don't like to hear the circumstance
mentioned."
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!" said Tallyho, "somebody was green upon the occasion; I thought
people in London were more guarded, and not so easily to be done. And
who did he prove to be after all?"
</p>
<p>
"No other than the well-known Major Semple, whose depredations of this
sort upon the public rendered him so notorious."
</p>
<p>
Having finished their repast, Tom was for a move; and they took their
way along Thames Street in the direction for Tower Hill.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XX
</h2>
<pre>
          "This life is all chequer'd with pleasures and woes
          That chase one another like waves of the deep,
          Each billow, as brightly or darkly it flows,
          Reflecting our eyes as they sparkle or weep;
          So closely our whims on our miseries tread,
          That the laugh is awak'd ere the tear can be dried;
          And as fast as the rain-drop of pity is shed,
          The goose-plumage of folly can turn it aside;
          But, pledge me the cup!  if existence can cloy
          With hearts ever light and heads ever wise,
          Be ours the light grief that is sister to joy,
          And the short brilliant folly that flashes and dies."
</pre>
<p>
"THE building before us," said Tom, "is the Tower of London, which was
formerly a palace inhabited by the various Sovereigns of this country
till the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Fitzstephens says, it was originally
built by Julius Cæsar; but I believe there is no proof of the truth
of this assertion, except that one of the towers is to this day called
Cæsar's Tower."
</p>
<p>
"It seems a place of great security," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Yes&mdash;William the Conqueror erected a fortress on part of its present
site, to overawe the inhabitants of London on his gaining possession
of the City, and about twelve years afterwards, in 1078, he erected a
larger building than the first, either on the site of the former or near
it. This building, repaired or rebuilt by succeeding Princes, is that
which is now called the White Tower."
</p>
<p>
"It appears altogether to be a very extensive building," said Tallyho;
"and what have we here? (turning his eyes to the left)&mdash;the modern style
of those form a curious contrast to that we are now viewing."
</p>
<p>
"That is called Trinity Square, and the beautiful edifice in the
centre is the Trinity House; it is a new building, of stone, having
the advantage of rising ground for its site, and of a fine area in the
front." <span class="pagenum">[306]</span> "The Trinity House," reiterated Bob, "some ecclesiastical
establishment, I presume, from its title?"
</p>
<p>
"There you are wrong," continued Dashall; "it is a Corporation, which
was founded in the year 1515 by Henry VIII. and consists of a Master,
four Wardens, eighteen Elder Brothers, in whom is vested the direction
of the Company, and an indefinite number of younger Brothers; for
any sea-faring man may be admitted into the Society by that name, but
without any part of the controul of its concerns. The elder Brethren are
usually selected from the most experienced commanders in the navy and
the merchants' service, with a few principal persons of his Majesty's
Government."
</p>
<p>
"But what, in the name of wonder," inquired Bob, "have Sailors to do
with the Trinity?"
</p>
<p>
"As much as other persons," was the reply; "if it is the anchor of hope,
as we are taught, they have as great a right to rely upon it as any
body else&mdash;besides, the names given to houses and places in London have
nothing to do with their occupations or situations, any more than
the common language of life has to do with nature; else why have we a
Waterloo House in the vicinity of St. Giles's for the sale of threads,
laces, and tapes&mdash;a Fleet for the confinement of prisoners, or the
King's Bench devoted to the same purposes, unless it is,
</p>
<pre>
          "That when we have no chairs at home,
          The King (God bless him) grants us then a bench."
</pre>
<p>
Though London contains a round of delights and conveniences scarcely to
be equalled, it is at the same time a combination of incongruities as
difficult to be conceived. The denomination of this House has therefore
nothing to do with the business to which it is devoted. The body which
transacts its concerns is called The Master, Wardens and Assistants, of
the Guild, or Fraternity of the most glorious and undivided Trinity,
and of St. Clement, in the parish of Deptford, Stroud, in the county of
Kent."
</p>
<p>
"An admirable illustration of your assertion," replied Bob; "and
pray may I be allowed, without appearing romantic or unnecessarily
inquisitive, to ask what are the objects of the Institution?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly. The use of this Corporation is to superintend the general
interests of the British shipping, military and commercial. To this end,
the powers of the <span class="pagenum">[307]</span> Corporation are very extensive; the principal
of which are, to examine the children educated in mathematics in
Christ's Hospital&mdash;examine the masters of the King's ships&mdash;appoint
pilots for the Thames&mdash;erect light-houses and sea-marks&mdash;grant licenses
to poor seamen, not free of the City, to row on the Thames&mdash;and
superintend the deepening and cleansing of the river; they have power
to receive donations for charitable purposes, and annually relieve great
numbers of poor seamen and seamen's widows and orphans; and as they
alone supply outward-bound ships with ballast, on notice of any shoal or
obstruction arising in the river Thames, they immediately direct their
men and lighters to work on it till it is removed. The profits arising
to the Corporation by this useful regulation is very considerable."
</p>
<p>
During this conversation they had continued to walk towards the Trinity
House, and were now close to it.
</p>
<p>
"Come," continued Dashall, "the interior is worth seeing: there are some
fine paintings in it, and the fitting up is altogether of an elegant
description."
</p>
<p>
Upon making application at the door, and the customary payment of a
shilling each, they were admitted. The appearance of the Hall, which is
grand, though light and elegant, particularly attracted the attention
of Tallyho. The double stair-case, which leads to the court-room, was an
object of peculiar delight. The beautiful model of the Royal William in
the Secretary's Office was much admired; but the Court-room was
abundant in gratification. Here they were ushered into a spacious
apartment,*particularly elegant, being unincumbered; the ceiling
finished in a superior style, and decorated with paintings of the late
King and Queen&mdash;James the Second&mdash;Lord Sandwich&mdash;Lord Howe, and Mr.
Pitt. Here Bob wandered from portrait to portrait, examining the
features and character of each, and admiring the skill and ability of
the artists. At the upper end of the room he was additionally pleased
to find a large painting containing a group of about twenty-four of
the elder Brethren, representing them at full length, attended by their
Secretary, the late Mr. Court. Many of the persons being well remembered
by Dashall, were pointed out by him to his Cousin, and brought to his
recollection names deservedly celebrated, though now no more. This
picture was the gift of the Merchant Brethren in 1794.
</p>
<p>
Tallyho was much delighted with his survey of this truly elegant
building, and the luminous account given by <span class="pagenum">[308]</span> his Cousin of
the various persons whose portraits met his eye, or whose names and
characters, connected with the establishment, had become celebrated for
scientific research or indefatigable industry.
</p>
<p>
"It will occupy too much time this morning," said Dashall, "to visit
the interior of the Tower, as I have dispatched a Ticket-porter to
Piccadilly, ordering my curricle to be at Tom's Coffee-house at one; we
will therefore defer that pleasure to the next opportunity of being this
way. We will however take a look at the Bank and the Exchange, then a
trundle into the fresh air for an hour, and return home to dinner; so
come along, but we will vary our walk by taking another road back."
</p>
<p>
With this intention, they now crossed Tower Hill, and turned to the
left, along the Minories.
</p>
<p>
"Here is a place," said Dashall, "well known, and no doubt you have
often heard of&mdash;Sparrow Corner and Rosemary Lane are better known by
the appellation of Rag Fair. It is a general mart for the sale of
second-hand clothes, and many a well-looking man in London is indebted
to his occasional rambles in this quarter for his appearance. The
business of this place is conducted with great regularity, and the
dealers and collectors of old clothes meet at a certain hour of the
afternoon to make sales and exchanges, so that it is managed almost upon
the same plan as the Royal Exchange, only that the dealers here come
loaded with their goods, which must undergo inspection before sales can
be effected: while the Merchant carries with him merely a sample, or
directs his Purchaser to the warehouse where his cargo is deposited. The
principal inhabitants of this place are Jews, and they obtain supplies
from the numerous itinerant collectors from all quarters of London and
its suburbs, whom you must have observed parading the streets from the
earliest hour of the morning, crying <i>Ould clothes&mdash;Clothes sale</i>."
</p>
<p>
"It surely can hardly be a trade worth following," said Talltho.
</p>
<p>
"There are many hundreds daily wandering the streets, however," replied
Tom, "in pursuit of cast-off apparel, rags, and metals of different
sorts, or at least pretend so. The Jews are altogether a set of traders.
I do not mean to confine my observations to them only, because there
are persons of other sects employed in the same kind of business; and
perhaps a more dangerous set of cheats could <span class="pagenum">[309]</span> scarcely be pointed
at, as their chief business really is to prowl about the houses and
stables of people of rank and fortune, in order to hold out temptations
to their servants, to pilfer and steal small articles not likely to be
missed, which these fellows are willing to purchase at about one-third
of their real value. It is supposed that upwards of 15,000 of these
depraved itinerants among the Jews are daily employed in journeys of
this kind; by which means, through the medium of base money and other
fraudulent dealings, many of them acquire property with which they open
shops, and then become receivers of stolen property; the losses thus
sustained by the public being almost incalculable&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
     "For wid coot gould rings of copper gilt&mdash;'tis so he gets his
     bread,
     Wit his sealing-vax of brick-dust, and his pencils without lead."
</pre>
<p>
It is estimated that there are from fifteen to twenty thousand Jews in
the Metropolis, and about five or six thousand more stationed in the
great provincial and seaport towns. In London they have six Synagogues,
and in the country places there are at least twenty more. Most of the
lower classes of those distinguished by name of German or Dutch Jews,
live principally by their wits, and establish a system of mischievous
intercourse all over the country, the better to enable them to carry
on then-fraudulent designs in every way. The pliability of their
consciences is truly wonderful&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
     "For they never stick at trifles, if there's monies in the way."
</pre>
<p>
Nay, I remember the time when they used to perambulate our streets
openly, professing to purchase base coin, by bawling&mdash;"Any bad shilling,
any bad shilling." The interference of the Police however has prevented
the calling, though perhaps it is impossible to prevent a continuance
of the practice any more than they can that of utterance. These men
hesitate not to purchase stolen property, or metals of various kinds, as
well as other articles pilfered from the Dock-yards, and stolen in
the provincial towns, which are brought to the Metropolis to elude
detection, and vice versa; in some cases there are contrivances that
the buyer and seller shall not even see each other, in order that no
advantage may be taken by giving information as to the parties." <span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
"Upon my life, the contrivances of London are almost incomprehensible,"
said Bob, "and might deter many from venturing into it; but this
surprises me beyond any thing."
</p>
<p>
"It is however too lamentably true," continued Tom; "for these people,
educated in idleness from the earliest infancy, acquire every debauched
and vicious principle which can fit them for the most complicated arts
of fraud and deception, to which they seldom fail to add the crime of
perjury, whenever it can be useful to shield themselves or their friends
from the punishment of the law. Totally without moral education, and
very seldom trained to any trade or occupation by which they can earn an
honest livelihood by manual labour&mdash;their youths excluded from becoming
apprentices, and their females from engaging themselves generally
as servants, on account of the superstitious adherence to the mere
ceremonial of their persuasion, as it respects meat not killed by
Jews&mdash;nothing can exceed their melancholy condition, both as it regards
themselves and society. Thus excluded from the resources which other
classes of the community possess, they seem to have no alternative
but to resort to those tricks and devices which ingenuity suggests,
to enable persons without an honest means of subsistence to live in
idleness.
</p>
<p>
"The richer Jews are in the practice of lending small sums to the poorer
classes of their community, in order that they may support themselves by
a species of petty traffic; but even this system contributes in no
small degree to the commission of crimes, since, in order to render
it productive to an extent equal to the wants of families who do not
acquire any material aid by manual labour, they are induced to resort to
unlawful means of increasing it, by which they become public nuisances.
From the orange-boy and the retailer of seals, razors, glass and other
wares, in the public streets, or the collector of
</p>
<pre>
          "Old rags, old jags, old bonnets, old bags,"
</pre>
<p>
to the shop-keeper, dealer in wearing apparel, or in silver and gold,
the same principles of conduct too generally prevail.
</p>
<p>
"The itinerants utter base money, to enable them by selling cheap, to
dispose of their goods; while those who are stationary, with very few
exceptions, receive and purchase at an under price whatever is brought
them, <span class="pagenum">[311]</span> without asking questions; and yet most of their concerns
are managed with so much art, that we seldom hear of a Jew being hanged;
and it is also a fact, that during the holidays (of which they have many
in the course of a year,) or at one of their weddings, you may see
the barrow-woman of yesterday decked out in gay and gaudy attire of an
expensive nature."
</p>
<p>
By this time they had reached the top of the minories, and were turning
down Houndsditch. "We are now," said Dashall, "close to another place
chiefly inhabited by Jews, called Duke's Place, where they have a very
elegant Synagogue, which has been visited by Royalty, the present King
having, during his Regency, honoured them with a visit, through the
introduction of the late Mr. Goldsmid. If it should be a holiday, we
will be present at the religious ceremonies of the morning." With this
they entered Duke's Place, and were soon within the walls of this Temple
of Judaism. In taking a view of it, Bob was much gratified with its
splendid decorations, and without being acquainted with their forms, had
<i>doffd his castor</i>,{1} but was presently informed by his Cousin that he
must keep his hat on. The readers appeared to him to be singers; but the
whole of the service being Hebrew, it was of little consequence to him,
whether read or sung. He perceived, during the performances of these
prayers, which were every now and then joined in by almost every
one present, that many of the congregation appeared to be in close
conversation, which, however, was taken no notice of by the persons
officiating. He was well pleased with the singing of a youth and the
accompaniment of a gentleman in a cock'd hat; for although he could not
discover that he actually produced words, he produced sounds in many
instances bearing a strong similarity to those of a bassoon. The
venerable appearance and devotion of the High Priest, who was habited in
a robe of white, also attracted his attention; while the frequent bursts
of the congregation, joining in the exercises of the morning, in some
instances almost provoked his risibility.
</p>
<p>
"The religious ceremonies of these people," said Tom, as they left the
synagogue, "though somewhat imposing as to form and appearance, do not
seem to be strongly interesting, for many of them are engaged during the
whole of the service in some species of traffic; buying and
</p>
<pre>
     1 Doff'd his castor&mdash;Taken off his hat.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[312]</span> selling, or estimating the value of goods for sale. They are such
determined merchants and dealers, that they cannot forget business even
in the house of prayer. We have two sets of them. This is the Dutch
Synagogue; but the most ancient is that of the Portuguese, having been
established in England ever since the Usurpation. The members of it
being mostly wealthy, are extremely attentive to their poor, among whom
there is said not to be a single beggar or itinerant; while the Dutch or
German. Jews get no education at all: even the most affluent of them are
said to be generally unable either to read or write the language of the
country that gave them birth. They confine themselves to a bastard or
vulgar Hebrew, which has little analogy to the original. They observe
the particular ritual of the German Synagogue, and also include the
Polish, Russian, and Turkish Jews established in London. With the
exception of a few wealthy individuals, and as many families who are in
trade on the Royal Exchange, they are in general a very indigent class
of people. Their community being too poor to afford them adequate
relief, they have resorted to the expedient of lending them small sums
of money at interest, to trade upon, which is required to be repaid
monthly or weekly, as the case may be, otherwise they forfeit all claim
to this aid.
</p>
<p>
"The Portuguese Jews are generally opulent and respectable, and hold
no community with the others. They use a different liturgy, and their
language is even different. They never intermarry with the Jews of the
Dutch Synagogue. They pride themselves on their ancestry, and give their
children the best education which can be obtained where they reside. The
Brokers upon the Exchange, of the Jewish persuasion, are all or chiefly
of the Portuguese Synagogue. Their number is limited to twelve by Act of
Parliament, and they pay 1000 guineas each for this privilege."
</p>
<p>
They had now reached the end of Houndsditch, when, passing through
Bishopsgate Church Yard and Broad Street, they were soon at the Bank.
</p>
<p>
"This building," said Dashall, "covers an extent of several acres of
ground, and is completely isolated."
</p>
<p>
"Its exterior," replied Bob, "is not unsuited to the nature of
the establishment, as it certainly conveys an idea of strength and
security."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[315]</span> "That's true," continued Tom; "but you may observe a want of
uniformity of design and proportion, arising from its having been
erected piece-meal, at different periods, and according to different
plans, by several architects. This is the principal entrance; and
opposite to it is the shortest street in the Metropolis, called Bank
Street; it contains but one house. Now we will take a survey of the
interior."
</p>
<p>
They entered the Hall, where Tallyho was much pleased to be instructed
as to the methodical way they have of examining notes for a re-issuing
or exchanging into coin.
</p>
<p>
"Here," said Dashall, "are the Drawing-offices for public and private
accounts. This room is seventy-nine feet long by forty; and, at the
further end, you observe a very fine piece of sculpture: that is a
marble Statue of King William III. the founder of the Bank. Thi national
establishment was first incorporated by act of Parliament in 1694. The
projector of the scheme was a Mr. James Paterson, a native of
Scotland; and the direction of its concerns is vested in a Governor,
Deputy-Governor, and twenty-four Directors, elected annually at a
general Court of the Proprietors. Thirteen of the Directors, with the
Governor, form a Court for the transaction of business. The Bank is open
every day from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon, holidays
excepted. It is like a little town. The Clerks at present are about
1000 in number, but a reduction is intended. The Rotunda is the most
interesting apartment&mdash;we will go and have a look at the Money-dealers.
</p>
<p>
"Here," continued he, as they entered the Rotunda, and mingled among
the various persons and sounds that are so well known in that seat
of traffic, "from the hours of eleven to three a crowd of eager
Money-dealers assemble, and avidity of gain displays itself in
ever-varying shapes, at times truly ludicrous to the disinterested
observer. You will presently perceive that the justling and crowding
of the Jobbers to catch a bargain, frequently exceed in disorder the
scrambling at the doors of our theatres for an early admission: and sa
loud and clamorous at times are the mingled noises of the buyers and
sellers, that all distinction of sound is lost in a general uproar."
</p>
<p>
Of this description, Tallyho had an absolute proof in <span class="pagenum">[314]</span> a few
minutes, for the mingling variety of voices appeared to leave no
space in time for distinguishing either the sense or the sound of the
individual speakers; though it was evident that, notwithstanding the
continual hubbub, there was a perfect understanding effected
between parties for the sale and transfer of Stock, according to the
stipulations bargained for.
</p>
<p>
"Ha, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;," said the Hon. Tom Dashall, "how do you do?"
</p>
<p>
"Happy to say well, Sir, thank you," was the reply. "Any
commands?&mdash;markets are pretty brisk this morning, and we are all alive."
</p>
<p>
"Pray," said Tallyho, "who is that extraordinary looking Lady with such
red lips and cheeks, beneath the garb of sadness?"
</p>
<p>
"A constant visitor here," replied Mr. M. "I may say a day scarcely
passes without her being present."
</p>
<p>
"She has a curious appearance," said Bob; "her dress is all black
from head to foot, and yet her cheeks disclose the ruddy glow of
uninterrupted health. Is it that her looks belie her garb, or that her
garb belies her looks?"
</p>
<p>
"Hush," said Mr. M. "let her pass, and I will give you some information
relative to her, which, if it does not gratify you, will at least
satisfy some of your inquiries. I am half inclined to believe that all
is not right in the seat of government with her, (pointing his finger to
his head;) and she is therefore rather deserving of pity than an object
of censure or ridicule; though I have reason to believe she frequently
meets with attacks of the latter, when in search of the sympathy and
benefit to be derived from a proper exercise of the former. Her name is
Miss W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Her father was formerly a two-penny postman, who resided
at Rockingham Row, Walworth, and was himself somewhat eccentric in his
dress and manners, and it was not at all unusual to meet him in
the morning in the garb of his office, though decidedly against his
inclination, and to see him on 'Change during 'Change hours, in silk
stockings, and in every other way dressed as a Merchant, attending
there according to custom and practice; and he managed, by some means
or other, to keep up a character of respectability, and to give an
accomplished education to the younger branches of this family; so that
this lady, though unfortunate in her present circumstances, has been
well brought up, and <span class="pagenum">[315]</span> mingled in polished society; and, if
you were to enter into conversation with her now, you would find
her intelligent in the selection of her words and the combination of
sentences, to explain to you the most improbable events, and the most
unheard of claims that she has upon all the Governments in the known
world. This, however, would be done with good temper, unless any thing
like an insulting observation should be conceived, or intended to be
conveyed."
</p>
<p>
"And, pray, what is supposed to be the cause of her present manners and
appearance?" inquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"It is principally attributed," replied Mr M. "to the circumstance of
losing a beloved brother, who she now continually declares is only kept
from her by the persons who daily visit the Rotunda, with a view
to prevent the recovery of the property she lays claim to, and the
particulars of which she generally carries in her pocket. That brother
however suffered the penalty of the law for a forgery;{1} but this she
cannot be induced to believe.
</p>
<pre>
     1 The lamentable effusion of blood which has taken place
     within the last twenty years, in consequence of forgeries on
     the Bank of England, has already excited a very considerable
     portion of public interest and indignation; and it is much
     to be feared that notwithstanding the very serious expence
     the Corporation have incurred, with a view to remedy the
     evil, by rendering the imitation more difficult, the
     anticipated result is not likely to be obtained. It will
     hardly be conceived that the Governors have expended as much
     as one hundred thousand pounds in this laudable undertaking,
     and, upon producing an impression, we are told it can be
     imitated by one, who, within three weeks produced a fac-
     simile, and puzzled the makers of the original note to
     discover which was the work-manship of their own hands. Nay,
     even an engraver on wood is said to have produced an
     excellent imitation in a few hours. It is however sincerely
     to be hoped that an effectual stop will be eventually put to
     the possibility of committing this crime, which, we
     apprehend, nine times out of ten brings the poor, needy,
     half-starved retailer of paper to the gallows, while the
     more un-principled wholesale dealer escapes detection.

     While on the subject of forged notes, we cannot help
     deprecating the circulation of what are termed <i>flash
     notes</i>, which, if not originally intended to deceive and
     defraud, are calculated to accomplish these objects, when in
     the hands of the artful and designing. We think there is a
     tradesman in the vicinity of the Bank who presents such of
     his customers as visits his repository to have their hair
     cut, &amp;c. with a Hash note, purporting to be for 501.; and we
     have also reason to believe that more than one attempt has
     been detected, where the parties have really endeavoured to
     pass them as valid Bank of England paper.    The danger
     therefore must be evident.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[316]</span> We have reason to think she is frequently much straitened for
want of the necessary supplies for sustenance, and she has temporary
relief occasionally from those who knew her family and her former
circumstances in life, while she boldly perseveres in the pursuit of
fancied property, and the restoration of her brother.
</p>
<p>
"I have heard her make heavy complaints of the difficulties she has had
to encounter, and the privations she has been subjected to; but her own
language will best speak the impressions on her mind. Here is a printed
letter which was circulated by her some time ago:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
To the worthy Inhabitants of the Parish of St. Mary, Newington, Surrey.
</p>
<p>
It is with feelings of deep regret I have to deplore the necessity that
compels me to adopt a public measure, for the purpose of obtaining my
property from those gentlemen that hold it in trust. For a period of ten
years I have endured the most cruel and unjustifiable persecution, which
has occasioned the premature death of my mother; a considerable loss of
property; all my personal effects of apparel and valuables; has exposed
me to the most wanton and barbarous attacks, the greatest insults, and
the severe and continual deprivation of every common necessary. Having
made every appeal for my right, or even a maintenance, without effect,
I now take the liberty of adopting the advice of some opulent friends in
the parish, and solicit general favour in a loan by subscription for a
given time, not doubting the liberal commiseration of many ladies
and gentlemen, towards so great a sufferer. As it is not possible to
describe the wrongs I have endured, the misery that has been heaped upon
me, in so limited a space, I shall be happy to give every explanation
upon calling for the result of this entreaty and to those ladies and
gentlemen that condescend to favour

</p>
<p>
"For the truth of this statement, or the real existence of any property
belonging to her, I am not able to vouch. She is well known in all
the offices of this great Establishment, is generally peaceable in
her conduct, and communicative in her conversation, which at times
distinguishes her as a person of good education."
</p>
<p>
"Hard is the fortune which your Sex attends, Women, like princes, find
few real friends; All who approach them their own ends pursue, Lovers
and ministers are seldom true. Hence oft from reason heedless beauty
strays, And the most trusted guide the most betrays."
</p>
<p>
The conversation was here interrupted by the arrival of a Gentleman,
who, taking Mr. M. on one side, Tom and Bob wished him a good morning.
They proceeded to <span class="pagenum">[318]</span> view the various offices which branch out
from the Rotunda, and which are appropriated to the management of each
particular stock, in each of which Bob could not help admiring the happy
disposition of every department to facilitate business. The arrangement
of the books, and the clerks, under the several letters of the alphabet,
he conceived was truly excellent.
</p>
<p>
"The Corporation of the Bank," said Dashall, "are prohibited from
trading in any sort of goods or merchandize whatsoever; but are to
confine the use of their capital to discounting Bills of Exchange, and
to the buying and selling of gold and silver bullion; with a permission
however to sell such goods as are mortgaged or pawned to them and not
redeemed within three months after the expiration of the time for their
redemption. Their profits arise from their traffic in bullion; the
discounting of Bills of Exchange for Bankers, Merchants, Factors, and
Speculators; and the remuneration they receive from Government, for
managing the public funds, and for receiving the subscriptions on loans
and lotteries. But we may ramble about in these places for a month, and
still have novelty in store; and there is a little world underneath the
greater part of this extensive building devoted to printing-offices,
ware-rooms, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>
They had now reached the door which leads into Bartholomew Lane, and,
upon descending the steps, and turning to the left, Bob's eyes soon
discovered the Auction Mart, "What have we here?" inquired he.
</p>
<p>
"That," replied his Cousin, "is a building which may deservedly be
rank'd as one of the ornaments of the City; and its arrangements and
economy, as well as the beauty of its interior, are well deserving the
notice of every stranger. This fine establishment, which serves as a
focus for the sale of estates and other property by public auction, is
both useful and ornamental; it was built about the time when the spirit
of combination was so strong in London. You must know, some years back,
every kind of business and trade appeared likely to be carried on by
Joint Stock Companies, and the profits divided upon small shares. Many
Fire-offices have to date their origin from this source&mdash;the Hope, the
Eagle, the Atlas, and others. The Golden Lane Brewery was opened
upon this principle; some Water Companies were established; till
neighbourhood <span class="pagenum">[319]</span> and partnership almost became synonimous; and, I
believe, among many other institutions of that kind, the Building before
us is one. It contains many handsome rooms and commodious offices; but,
as for offices, every street and every alley abounds with them, and,
now-a-days, if you want to hire a Cook or a Scullion, you have nothing
to do but to send a letter to a Register-office, and you are suited in
a twinkling. It was an excellent idea, and I remember the old Buck who
used to call himself the founder of establishments of that nature, or
rather the first introducer of them to the notice of Englishmen, poor
old Courtois."
</p>
<p>
John Courtois is said to have been a native of Picardy, where he was
born about the year 1737 or 1738. He repaired to this country while yet
young, in the character of <i>valet de chambre</i> to a gentleman who had
picked him up in his travels; and, as he came from one of the poorest
of the French provinces, he "took root," and throve wonderfully on his
transplantation to a richer soil.
</p>
<p>
On the death of his master, he removed to the neighbourhood of the
Strand; and St. Martin's Street,. Leicester Square, became the scene of
his industry and success. At a time when wigs were worn by boys, and a
Frenchman was supposed the only person capable of making one fit "for
the grande monarque," he commenced business as a perruquier, and
soon acquired both wealth and celebrity. To this he joined another
employment, which proved equally lucrative and appropriate, as it
subjected both masters and servants to his influence. This was the
keeping of a register-office, one of the first known in the Metropolis,
whence he drew incalculable advantages. He is also said to have been a
dealer in hair, which he imported largely from the continent. And yet,,
after all, it is difficult to conceive how he could have realized a
fortune exceeding 200,000L.! But what may not be achieved by a man who
despised no gains, however small, and in his own expressive language,
considered farthings as "the seeds of guineas!"
</p>
<p>
The following appears to be a true description of this very
extraordinary man, whom we ourselves have seen more than once:&mdash;"Old
Courtois was well known for more than half a century in the purlieus of
St. Martin's and the Haymarket. His appearance was meagre and squalid,
and his clothes, such as they were, were <span class="pagenum">[320]</span> pertinaciously got up in
exactly the same cut and fashion, and the colour always either fawn or
marone. For the last thirty years, the venerable chapeau was uniformly
of the same cock. The principal feat, however, in which this fervent
votary of Plutus appeared before the public, was his nearly fatal affair
with Mary Benson, otherwise Mrs. Maria Theresa Phepoe. In April 1795,
this ill-fated-woman projected a rather bungling scheme, in order
to frighten her old acquaintance and visitor, Courtois, out of a
considerable sum of money. One evening, when she was certain of his
calling, she had her apartment prepared for his reception in a species
of funereal style&mdash;a bier, a black velvet pall, black wax candles
lighted, &amp;c. No sooner had the friend entered the room, than the lady,
assisted by her maid, pounced on him, forced him into an arm chair,
in which he was forcibly held down by the woman, while the hostess,
brandishing a case-knife or razor, swore with some violent imprecations,
that instant should be his last, if he did not give her an order on his
"banker for a large sum of money. The venerable visitor, alarmed at the
gloomy preparations and dire threats of the desperate female, asked for
pen, ink, and paper; which being immediately produced, he wrote a check
on his banker for two thousand pounds. He immediately retired with
precipitation, happy to escape without personal injury. The next
morning, before its opening, he attended at the Banker's, with some
Police-officers; and on Mrs. Phepoe's making her appearance with the
check, she was arrested, and subsequently tried at the Old Bailey, on a
capital charge, grounded on the above proceedings. However, through
the able defence made by her counsel (the late Mr. Fielding) who took a
legal objection to the case as proved, and contended that she never
had or obtained any property of Mr. Courtois, on the principle that
possession constituted the first badge of ownership, she was only
sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment."
</p>
<p>
"Some years since, the late Lord Gage met Courtois, at the court-room of
the East India House, on an election business. "Ah, Courtois!" said his
Lordship, "what brings you here?"&mdash;'To give my votes, my Lord,' was the
answer.&mdash;"What! are you a proprietor?&mdash;'Most certainly.'&mdash;"And of more
votes than one?"&mdash;'Yes, my <span class="pagenum">[321]</span> Lord, I have four!'&mdash;"Aye, indeed! why
then, before you take the book, pray be kind enough to pin up my curls!"
With which modest request the proprietor of four votes, equal to ten
thousand pounds, immediately complied!
</p>
<p>
"M. Courtois married a few years since, and has left several children.
On reflecting that his widow's thirds would amount to an immense sum,
with his usual prudence he made a handsome settlement on her during
his lifetime. As his sons were not of very economical habits, he has
bequeathed them small annuities only; and vested the bulk of his fortune
in trustees on behalf of his daughters, who are infants.
</p>
<p>
"Until his death, he invariably adhered to the costume of the age in
which he was born. A three-cocked hat, and a plum-coloured coat,
both rather the worse for wear, in which we have seen him frequently,
invariably designated his person and habits; while a penurious economy,
that bid defiance to all vulgar imitation, accompanied him to his grave.
His death occurred in 1819, in the 80th or 81st year of his age."
</p>
<p>
"Such characters," observed Tallyho, "notwithstanding their
eccentricity, afford useful lessons to those who, in this giddy and
dissipated age, devote a part of their time to thinking."
</p>
<p>
"No doubt of it," replied Dashall; "they furnish examples of what may
be done by perseverance and determination, and almost seem to verify the
assertion, that every one may become rich if he pleases. But come, we
must move towards Tom's Coffee House, in our way to which we will
pass through the Royal Exchange, which lies directly before us. It was
originally a brick building, erected by Sir Thomas Gresham in the year
1567, but being destroyed by the fire of London in 1666, the present
building of Portland stone was raised in its place, the first stone
of which was laid by Charles II. in 1667; in consequence of which his
statue has been placed in the centre of its quadrangle, around which the
Merchants assemble daily to transact their commercial business.{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 The merry Monarch was fond of the Citizens, and frequently
     honoured the Lord Mayor's table with his presence. It is
     said of him, that, on retiring to his carriage one day after
     dining with the civic Sovereign, he was followed by the
     latter, who, with a freedom inspired by the roseate Deity,
     laid hold of His Majesty by the arm, and insisted that he
     should not go until he had drunk t'other bottle. The Monarch
     turned round, and good-humouredly repeating a line from an
     old song&mdash;"The man that is drunk is as great as a king,"
     went back to the company, and doubtless complied with the
     Lord Mayor's request.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[322]</span> "It has two principal fronts, one in Cornhill, and the other,

has a piazza, affording a convenient shelter from the sun and rain.
It is open as a thoroughfare from eight in the morning till six in the
evening; but the hours in which business is chiefly transacted, are from
two to five. Its extent is 203 feet by 171."
</p>
<p>
By this time they had passed the gate, and Bob found himself in a
handsome area with a fine piazza carried entirely round, and furnished
with seats along the four walks, for Merchants of different nations, who
meet, each at their different stations, and was immediately attracted
by the appearance of the numerous specimens of art with which it was
adorned.
</p>
<p>
"Do you observe," said his Cousin, "within these piazzas are
twenty-eight niches; all vacant but that in which is placed a statue of
Sir Thomas Gresham, in the north-west angle; and that in the south-west,
which presents a statue of Sir John Barnard, Magistrate of the City, and
one of its Representatives in Parliament. Those smaller statues in the
niches of the wall of the Quadrangle, in the upper story, are the Kings
and Queens of England, beginning with Edward I. on the North side, and
ending with his late Majesty on the East. As far as Charles I. they were
executed by Gabriel Cibber. The various frames which are placed around
under the piazza, contain the names, residences and occupations of
Tradesmen, Mechanics and others. The grand front in Cornhill has
been under repair lately, and in its appearance, no doubt, is greatly
improved. The steeple which is just raised, is a handsome dome,
surmounted by the original grasshopper, rendered somewhat celebrated by
a prophecy, that certain alterations would take place in men, manners,
and times, when the grasshopper on the top of the Exchange should meet
the dragon at the top of Bow Church; and strange and extraordinary as it
may appear, this very circumstance is said to have taken place, as
they have both been seen in the warehouse of some manufacturer, to
whom <span class="pagenum">[323]</span> they were consigned for repair; in addition to which, if
Crockery's{1} relation of the transmogrifications of England is to
be believed, the prophecy is in a considerable degree a whimsical and
laughable Burletta, in one act, has recently been produced at the Royal
Coburg Theatre, in which Mr. Sloman sings, with admirable comicality,
the following Song, alluded to by the Hon. Tom Dashall, to the tune of
O, The Roast Beef of Old England.

          "From Hingy I came with my Master, O dear,

</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[324]</span>There is a stair-case in each front, and one on each side, which
lead to a gallery above, running round the whole building, containing
the offices of various establishments; but I believe, in the original
plan, shops were intended to fill the building to the top. At present,
the upper rooms are occupied by Lloyd's celebrated Subscription
Coffee-house, for the use of Under-writers and Merchants&mdash;by the Royal
Exchange Insurance Company, and various offices of individuals. There
are also the Gresham Lecture&mdash;Rooms, where lectures are read pursuant to
the will of the late Sir Thomas Gresham, who bequeathed to the City of
London and the Mercers' Company, all the profits arising from these and
other premises in Cornhill, in trust to pay salaries to four lecturers
in divinity, astronomy, music, and geometry; and three readers in civil
law, physic, and rhetoric, who read lectures daily in term time.

<p>
"This we may consider the grand mart of the universe! where congregate
those sons of Commerce the British Merchants, who, in dauntless extent
of enterprise, hold such distinguished pre-eminence!"
</p>
<p>
Tallyho viewed the scene before him with an inquisitive eye, and was
evidently wrapped in surprise at the "busy hum of men," all actuated
by one universal object, the acquisition of wealth. The spacious area
exhibited a mass of mercantile speculators, numerously grouped, in
conversation; under the piazzas appeared a moving multitude in like
manner engaged, while the surrounding seats were in similar occupation;
Dashall and Bob, of the many hundreds of individuals present, were
perhaps the only two led to the place by curiosity alone.
</p>
<p>
Tallyho, who, on every occasion of "doubtful dilemma," looked to his
cousin Dashall for extrication, expressed his surprise at the appearance
of a squalid figure, whose lank form, patched habiliments, and unshorn
beard, indicated <span class="pagenum">[325]</span>extreme penury; in familiar converse with a
gentleman fashionably attired, and of demeanour to infer unquestionable
respectability.
</p>
<p>
"Interest," said Tallyho, "supersedes every other consideration, else
these two opposites would not meet."
</p>
<p>
"Your observation is just," replied his cousin; "the tatterdemallion to
whom you allude, is probably less impoverished than penurious; perhaps
of miserly habits, and in other respects disqualified for polite
society. What then, he is doubtless in ample possession of the essential
requisite; and here a monied man only is a good man, and without money
no man can be respectable."{1}
</p>
<p>
Here the continued and deafening noise of a hand-bell, rung by one
of the Exchange-keepers underlings, perched on the balcony over the
southern gate, interrupted Mr. Dashall's remarks; it was the signal for
locking up the gates, and inferring at the same time obedience to the
summons with due promptitude and submission, on pain of being detained
two hours "in duresse vile."
</p>
<p>
Sufficient alacrity of egression not having been shown, the Keepers
closed the two gates, and at the same time locked the east and western
avenues; thus interdicting from egress above three hundred contumacious
individuals, including the Hon. Tom Dashall and his Cousin.
</p>
<p>
A considerable time having now elapsed without any prospect of
enlargement, dissatisfaction gained ground apace, and shortly ripened
into actual mutiny. The disaffected now proceeded to hold a council of
war, and after a few moments deliberation, it was resolved unanimously
to storm the avenues! Dashall and
</p>
<p>
1 Some years ago, a gentleman of extensive property, residing in the
country, was desirous of raising, by way of loan on the security of
landed estates, the sum of 30,000L. His Solicitor in London, with whom
he had corresponded on the subject, summoned him at last to town; a
lender was found, who was to meet the Solicitor at a certain time and
place appointed, in the neighbourhood of the Exchange. The borrower,
on the day and near the hour fixed upon, was in the area of the Royal
Exchange, when there crossed over a wretched looking being, the very
personification of misery. The gentleman, unsolicited, gave the poor
object a shilling. On going to the appointed rendezvous, how great was
his astonishment to find in the person of the wealthy monied man the
identical receiver of his bounty!&mdash;"Ha, ha," cried he, "you shall not
fare the worse for your generosity!" and actually advanced the money
on terms much easier than expected. This personage was the celebrated
Daniel Dancer.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[326]</span> Tallyho declined taking any part in the enterprise; they took a
right view of the affair; they were mere casual visitants, not likely
ever again to suffer a similar restraint, while the others were in the
daily practice of transacting business on the spot: to them therefore
the frequent recurrence of the present disaster might happen&mdash;theirs
then was the cause, as being most particularly interested.
</p>
<p>
An attack was made by the prisoners upon the portals opening into Bank
Buildings and Sweeting's Kents; but the former having been shattered
sometime since on a similar occasion, and subsequently very strongly
repaired, it was found impregnable, at least to any immediate exertion
of force, and being neither furnished with a park of artillery, nor with
the battering ram of the ancients, the little army faced to the right
about, enfiladed the area, and took up a new position, in due order of
assault, against the door of the avenue leading into Sweeting's Rents.
The affair was decided, and without bloodshed; the bars soon bent before
the vigour of the assailants; one of these was taken into custody by a
Beadle, but rescued, and the attack recommenced with success; when the
opposite door was also opened by the Shop-keeper living in that avenue,
and the Exchange was finally cleared at four minutes past five o'clock,
after above an hour's detention, including the time occupied in storming
the avenues.
</p>
<p>
The triumph of liberty was now complete; the intrepid phalanx disbanded
itself; and our Heroes having made the farewell conge to their
victorious compeers, proceeded into Cornhill, where, Dashall espying
his curricle at the door of Tom's Coffee House, they, after refreshing
themselves, took a cheerful country drive over London Bridge, Clapham
Common, Wandsworth, &amp;c. from which they returned at six o'clock to
dinner, determined to have a night's rest before they proceeded in
search of further adventures.<span class="pagenum">[327]</span>

    CHAPTER XXI
</h2>
<pre>
          "Happy the man, who void of cares and strife,
          In silken or in leathern purse retains
          A SPLENDID shilling! he nor hears with pain
          New oysters cried, nor sighs for cheerful ale;

          But I, whom griping penury surrounds,
          And hunger, sure attendant upon want,
          With scanty offal and small acid tiff,
          Wretched repast, my meagre corse sustain!
          Or solitary walk, or dose at home
          In garret vile!"
</pre>
<p>
TALKING over, at the breakfast-table, the occurrences of the preceding
day&mdash;"On my conscience!" exclaimed Tallyho, "were the antediluvian
age restored, and we daily perambulated the streets of this immense
Metropolis during a hundred years to come, I firmly believe that every
hour would bring a fresh accession of incident."
</p>
<p>
"Ad infinitum," answered Dashall; "where happiness is the goal in
view, and fifteen hundred thousand competitors start for the prize, the
manouvres of all in pursuit of the grand ultimatum must ever exhibit an
interesting and boundless variety. London,
</p>
<pre>
          ".   .   .   the needy villain's general home,
          The common sewer of Paris and of Rome!"
</pre>
<p>
where ingenious vice too frequently triumphs over talented worth&mdash;where
folly riots in the glare of luxury, and merit pines in indigent
obscurity.&mdash;Allons donc!&mdash;another ramble, and chance may probably
illustrate my observation."
</p>
<p>
"Take notice," said the discriminating Dashall to his friend, as they
reached the Mall in St. James's Park, "of that solitary knight of the
woeful countenance; his thread-bare raiment and dejected aspect, denote
disappointment and privation;&mdash;ten imperial sovereigns to a plebeian
<span class="pagenum">[328]</span> shilling, he is either a retired veteran or a distressed poet."
</p>
<p>
The object of curiosity, who had now seated himself, appeared to have
attained the age of fifty, or more&mdash;a bat that had once been
black&mdash;a scant-skirted blue coat, much the worse for wear&mdash;a striped
waistcoat&mdash;his lank legs and thighs wrapt in a pair of something
resembling trowsers, but "a world too wide for his shrunk shanks"&mdash;short
gaiters&mdash;shoes in the last stage of consumption&mdash;whiskers of full
dimensions&mdash;his head encumbered with an unadjusted redundancy-of grey
hair: such were the habiliments and figure of this son of adversity!
</p>
<p>
The two friends now seated themselves on the same bench with the
stranger, who, absorbed in reflection, observed not their approach.
</p>
<p>
The silence of the triumvirate was broken in upon by Tom, who, with his
usual suavity of manners, politely addressed himself to the unknown,
on the common topic of weather, <i>et cetera</i>, without eliciting in reply
more than an assenting or dissenting monosyllable, "You have seen some
service, Sir?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"In the army, I presume?"
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"Under Government?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"In the navy, probably?"
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
"I beg your pardon," continued Dashall&mdash;"my motives originate not in
idle inquisitiveness; if I can be of any service&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
The stranger turned towards him an eye of inquiry. "I ask not from
impertinent curiosity," resumed Dashall, "neither would I wish
indelicately to obtrude an offer of assistance, perhaps equally
unnecessary as unacceptable; yet there are certain mutabilities of life
wherein sympathy may be allowed to participate."
</p>
<p>
"Sir," said the other, with an immediate grateful expansion of mind, and
freedom of communication&mdash;"I am inexpressibly indebted for the honour
of your solicitude, and feel no hesitation in acknowledging that I am
a literary writer; but so seldom employed, and, when employed, so
inadequately requited, that to me the necessaries of life are frequently
inaccessible."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[329]</span> Here Tallyho interrupted the narrator by asking&mdash;whence it
was that he had adopted a profession so irksome, precarious, and
unproductive?
</p>
<pre>
"Necessity," was the reply. "During a period of eight years, I performed
the duties as senior Clerk of an office under Government; four years
ago the establishment was broken up, without any provision made for its
subordinate dependents; and thus I became one of the twenty thousand
distressed beings in London, who rise from bed in the morning, unknowing
where to repose at night, and are indebted to chance for a lodging or a
dinner!"{1}     1 The following calculation, which is curious in all its
     parts, cannot fail to interest the reader:&mdash;

     The aggregate Population on the surface of the known
     habitable Globe is estimated at 1000,000,000 souls. If
     therefore we reckon with the Ancients, that a generation
     lasts 30 years, then in that space 1000,000,000 human beings
     will be born and die; consequently, 91,314 must be dropping
     into eternity every day, 3800 every hour, or about 63 every
     minute, and more than one every second. Of these
     1000,000,000 souls, 656,000,000 are supposed to be Pagans,
     160,000,000 Mahomedans, 9,000,000 Jews, only 175,000,000 are
     called Christians, and of these only 50,000,000 are
     Protestants.

     There are in London 502 places of Worship&mdash;one Cathedral,
     one Abbey, 114 Churches, 132 Chapels and Chapels of Ease,
     220 Meet-ings and Chapels for Dissenters, 43 Chapels for
     Foreigners, and 6 Synagogues for Jews. About 4050 public and
     private Schools, including Inns of Courts, Colleges, &amp;c.
     About 8 Societies for Morals; 10 Societies for Learning and
     Arts; 112 Asylums for Sick and Lame; 13 Dispensaries, and
     704 Friendly Societies. Charity distributed £800,000 per
     annum.

     There are about 2500 persons committed for trial in one
     year: The annual depredations amount to about £2,100,000.
     There are 19 Prisons, and 5204 Alehouses within the bills of
     Mortality. The amount of Coin counterfeited is £200,000 per
     annum. Forgeries on the Bank of England in the year
     £150,000. About 3000 Receivers of Stolen Goods. About 10,000
     Servants at all times out of place. Above 20,000 miserable
     individuals rise every morning without knowing how or by
     what means they are to be supported during the passing day,
     or where, in many instances, they are to lodge on the
     succeeding night.

     London consumes annually 112,000 bullocks; 800,000 sheep and
     lambs; 212,000 calves; 210,000 hogs; 60,000 sucking pigs;
     7,000,000 gallons of milk, the produce of 9000 cows; 10,000
     acres of ground cultivated for vegetables; 4000 acres for
     fruit; 75,000 quarters of wheat; 700,000 chaldrons of coals;
     1,200,500 barrels of ale and porter; 12,146,782 gallons of
     spirituous liquors and compounds; 35,500 tons of wine;
     17,000,000 pounds of butter, 22,100,000 pounds of cheese;
     14,500 boat loads of cod.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[330]</span> "May I ask," said Mr. Dashall, "from what species of literary
composition you chiefly derive your subsistence?"
</p>
<p>
"From puffing&mdash;writing rhyming advertisements for certain speculative
and successful candidates for public favour, in various avocations;
for instance, eulogizing the resplendent brilliancy of Jet or Japan
Blacking&mdash;the wonderful effects of Tyrian-Dye and Macassar Oil in
producing a luxuriant growth and changing the colour of the hair,
transforming the thinly scattered and hoary fragments of age to the
redundant and auburn tresses of youth&mdash;shewing forth that the "Riding
Master to his late Majesty upwards of thirty years, and Professor of the
Royal Menage of Hanover, sets competition at defiance, and that all who
dare presume to rival the late Professor of the Royal Menage of Hanover,
are vile unskilful pretenders, ci-devant stable-boys, and totally
undeserving the notice of an enlightened and discerning public! In fact,
Sir, I am reduced to this occasional humiliating employment, derogatory
certainly to the dignity of literature, as averting the approach of
famine. I write, for various adventurers, poetical panegyric, and
illustrate each subject by incontrovertible facts, with appropriate
incident and interesting anecdote."
</p>
<p>
"And these facts," observed Bob Tallyho, "respectably authenticated?"
</p>
<p>
"By no means," answered the Poet; "nor is it necessary, nobody takes the
trouble of inquiry, and all is left to the discretion of the writer and
the fertility of his invention."
</p>
<p>
"On the same theme, does not there exist," asked Dashall, "a difficulty
in giving it the appearance of variety?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly; and that difficulty would seem quite insurmountable when
I assure you, that I have written for a certain Blacking Manufacturer
above two hundred different productions on the subject of his
unparalleled Jet, each containing fresh incident, and very probably
fresh incident must yet be found for two hundred productions more! But
the misfortune is, that every thing is left to my invention, and the
remuneration is of a very trifling nature for such mental labour:
besides, it has frequently happened that the toil has proved
unavailing&mdash;the production is rejected&mdash;the anticipated half-crown
remains in the accumulating coffers of the Blacking-manufacturer, and
the Author returns, pennyless and despondingly, to his attic, where, if
fortune at last befriends him, he probably may breakfast dine and
sup, tria juncta in uno, at a late hour in the evening!" <span class="pagenum">[331]</span> "And,"
exclaimed the feeling Dashall, "this is real Life in London!"
</p>
<p>
"With me actually so," answered the Poet.
</p>
<p>
The Blacking-maker's Laureat now offered to the perusal of his
sympathising friends the following specimen of his ability in this mode
of composition:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          PUG IN ARMOUR;
          OR,
          THE GARRISON ALARMED.

          "Whoe'er on the rock of Gibraltar has been,
          A frequent assemblage of monkeys has seen
          Assailing each stranger with volleys of stones,
          As if pre-determin'd to fracture his bones!

          A Monkey one day took his turn as a scout,
          And gazing his secret position about,
          A boot caught his eye, near the spot that was plac'd,
          By w * * * *n's jet; Blacking transcendently grac'd;
          And, viewing his shade in its brilliant reflection,
          He cautiously ventured on closer inspection.

          The gloss on its surface return'd grin for grin,
          Thence seeking his new-found acquaintance within,
          He pok'd in the boot his inquisitive snout,
          Head and shoulders so far, that he could not get out;
          And thus he seem'd cas'd&mdash;from his head to his tail,
          In suit of high-burnish'd impregnable mail!

          Erect on two legs then, with retrograde motion,
          It stalk'd; on the Sentry impressing a notion
          That this hostile figure, of non-descript form,
          The fortress might take by manoeuvre or storm!

          Now fixing his piece, in wild terror he bawls&mdash;
          "A legion of devils are scaling the walls!"
          The guards sallied forth 'mid portentous alarms,
          Signal-guns were discharged, and the drums beat to arms;
          And Governor then, and whole garrison, ran
          To meet the dread foe in this minikin man!

          "A man&mdash;'tis a monkey!" Mirth loudly exclaim'd,
          And peace o'er the garrison then was proclaim'd;
          And Pug was released, the strange incident backing
          The merits, so various, of W* * * *n's Jet Blacking."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[332]</span> This trifle, well enough for the purpose, was honoured with
approbation.
</p>
<p>
The two friends, unwilling to offend the delicacy of the Poet by a
premature pecuniary compliment at this early stage of acquaintance, took
his address and departed, professing an intention of calling upon him at
his lodgings in the evening.
</p>
<p>
"I would not, were I a bricklayer's labourer," exclaimed Bob, "exchange
situations with this unfortunate literary hack&mdash;this poor devil of
mental toil and precarious result, who depends for scanty subsistence on
the caprice of his more fortunate inferiors, whose minds, unexpanded
by liberal feeling, and absorbed in the love of self, and the
sordid consideration of interest, are callous to the impression of
benevolence!&mdash;But let us hope that few such cases of genius in
adversity occur, even in this widely extended and varied scene of human
vicissitude."
</p>
<p>
"That hope," replied his Cousin, "is founded on
</p>
<pre>
          "The baseless fabric of a vision!"
</pre>
<p>
There are, at this moment, thousands in London of literary merit, of
whom we may truly say,
</p>
<pre>
          "Chill penury repress their noble rage,
          And freeze the genial current of the soul!"
</pre>
<p>
Men unsustained by the hand of friendship, who pine in unheeded
obscurity, suffering the daily privations of life's indispensable
requisites, or obtaining a scanty pittance at the will of opulent
ignorance, and under the humiliating contumely, as we have just been
informed, even of Blacking Manufacturers!
</p>
<p>
"But here is a man, who, during a period of eight years, held a public
situation, the duties of which he performed satisfactorily to the last;
and yet, on the abolition of the establishment, while the Principal
retires in the full enjoyment of his ample salary, this senior Clerk
and his fellows in calamity are cast adrift upon the world, to live or
starve, and in the dearth of employment suitable to their habits and
education, the unfortunate outcasts are left to perish, perhaps by the
hand of famine in the streets, or that of despondency in a garret;
or, what is worse than either, consigned to linger out their remaining
wretched <span class="pagenum">[333]</span> days under the "cold reluctant charity" of a parish
workhouse.{1}
</p>
<p>
"When the principal of a Public-office has battened for many years on
his liberal salary, and the sole duties required of him have been those
of occasionally signing a few official papers, why not discontinue his
salary on the abolition of the establishment, and partition it out in
pensions to those disbanded Clerks by whose indefatigable exertions
the business of the public has been satisfactorily conducted? These
allowances, however inadequate to the purpose of substantiating all
the comforts, might yet realise the necessaries of life, and, at least,
would avert the dread of absolute destitution."
</p>
<p>
A pause ensued&mdash;Dashall continued in silent rumination&mdash;a few moments
brought our Heroes to the Horse Guards; and as the acquirement "devoutly
to be wished" was a general knowledge of metropolitan manners, they
proceeded to the observance of Real Life in a Suttling House.
</p>
<p>
Child's Suttling House at the Horse Guards is the almost exclusive
resort of military men, who, availing themselves of the intervals
between duty, drop in to enjoy a pipe and pint.
</p>
<pre>
          "To fight their battles o'er again,
          Thrice to conquer all their foes,
          And thrice to slay the slain."
</pre>
<p>
In the entrance on the left is a small apartment, bearing the dignified
inscription, in legible characters on the door, of "The Non-Commissioned
Officers' Room." In front of the bar is a larger space, boxed off,
and appropriated to the use of the more humble heroical aspirants, the
private men; and passing through the bar, looking into Whitehall, is
the <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>, for the reception of the more exalted rank, the
golden-laced, three-striped, subordinate commandants, Serjeant-Majors
and Serjeants, with the colour-clothed regimental appendants of
Paymasters and Adjutants' Clerks, <i>et cetera</i>. Into this latter
apartment our accomplished friends were ushered with becoming

</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[334]</span> respect to their superior appearance, at the moment when a warm
debate was carrying on as to the respective merits of the deceased
Napoleon and the hero of Waterloo.
</p>
<p>
The advocate of the former seemed unconnected with the army: the
adherent to the latter appeared in the gaudy array of a Colour-Serjeant
of the Foot Guards, and was decorated with a Waterloo medal,
conspicuously suspended by a blue ribbon to the upper button of his
jacket; and of this honourable badge the possessor seemed not less vain
than if he had been adorned with the insignia of the most noble order of
the Garter.
</p>
<p>
"I contend, and I defy the universe to prove the contrary," exclaimed
the pertinacious Serjeant in a tone of authoritative assertion,
"that the Duke of Wellington is a greater man than ever did, does, or
hereafter may exist!"
</p>
<p>
"By no means," answered the Civilian. "I admit, so far as a thorough
knowledge of military tactics, and a brilliant career of victory
constitutes greatness, his grace of Wellington to be a great hero, but
certainly not the greatest 'inan that ever did, does, or hereafter may
exist!" "Is there a greater man? Did there ever exist a greater?&mdash;when
and where?" the Serjeant impatiently demanded.
</p>
<p>
"Buonaparte was a greater," answered the opposing disputant; "because to
military renown unparalleled in the annals of ancient or modern history,
he added the most consummate knowledge of government; and although his
actions might frequently partake of arbitrary sway, (and who is the
human being exempted from human frailty) yet he certainly created and
sustained, in her most elevated zenith, the splendour of France, till
crushed by the union of nations in arms; and if power is the criterion
of greatness, who was, is, or ever can be greater than the man, who,
emerging from obscurity, raised himself solely by his mental energies
to the highest elevation of human glory; and who, this Island excepted,
commanded the destinies of all Europe! The most determined of his
enemies will not deny, calmly and duly appreciating his merits, that he
possessed unrivalled talent; and this fact the hero, whose cause you
so vehemently espouse, would, I have no doubt, be the foremost in
acknowledging."
</p>
<p>
In deficiency of argument, the Serjeant resorted to invective; the
vociferous disputation reached the next <span class="pagenum">[335]</span> room, and was taken up by
the rank and file in a manner not less tumultuous; when an honest native
of the "Emerald Isle" good-humouredly terminated the war of words,
calling for half a quartern of gin, with which to qualify a pint of
Whitbread's entire.
</p>
<p>
"To the immortal memory of St. Patrick, and long life to him!" exclaimed
Patrick O'Shaughnessy. "If there did not exist but them two selves, bad
luck to the spalpeen who will say that the Duke and my Lord Londondery
would not be the greatest men in the universe!"
</p>
<p>
This sally led to a cessation of hostilities, which might have been
followed by a definitive treaty of peace, but the dæmon of discord again
made its appearance in the tangible shape of a diminutive personage,
who, hitherto silently occupying a snug out-of-the-way corner by the
fireplace, had escaped observation.
</p>
<p>
Dashall and his Cousin emerging from the Sanctum Sanctorum, where
their presence seemed to have operated as a check on the freedom of
discussion, had just seated themselves in the room allotted to the
private soldiers, when, in a broad northern accent, the aforesaid
taciturn gentleman, selecting the two strangers, who, of all the
company, seemed alone worthy the honour of his notice, thus addressed
them:
</p>
<p>
"I crave your pardon, Sirs&mdash;but I guess frae your manner that ye are
no unacquainted wi' the movements o' high life&mdash;do you ken how lang the
King means to prolong his abode amang our neebors owre the water, his
hair-brain'd Irish subjects, whase notions o' loyalty hae excited sae
mony preposterously antic exhibitions by that volatile race O' people?"
</p>
<p>
"I am not in possession," answered Dashall, "of any information on the
subject."
</p>
<p>
"By the manes of the Priest," exclaimed Mr. O'Shaughnessy, "but the King
(God bless him) has visited the land of green Erin, accompanied by the
spirit of harmony, and praties without the sauce of butter-milk be his
portion, who does not give them both a hearty welcome!&mdash;Arrah, what mane
you by a preposterous exhibition? By hecky, the warm hearts of the sons
and daughters of St. Patrick have exhibited an unsophisticated feeling
of loyalty, very opposite indeed to the chilling indifference, not to
say worse of it, of those his subjects at home; and as Sir William, the
big Baronet of the City, said in the House <span class="pagenum">[336]</span> that gives laws to the
land, Why should not his Majesty be cheered up a little?"
</p>
<p>
This effusion of loyalty was well received, and Dashall and his Cousin
cordially united in the general expression of approbation.
</p>
<p>
"This is a' vera weel," said the Northern; "but an overstrained civility
wears ay the semblance o' suspicion, and fulsome adulation canna be vera
acceptable to the mind o' delicate feeling: for instance, there is
my ain country, and a mair ancient or a mair loyal to its legitimate
Sovereign there disna exist on the face o' the whole earth; wad the King
condescend to honor wi' his presence the palace o' Holyrod House, he
wad experience as ardent a manifestation o' fidelity to his person and
government in Auld Reekie as that shown him in Dublin, though aiblins
no quite sae tumultuous; forbye, it wadna hae been amiss to hae gaen
the preference to a nation whare his ancestors held sway during sae mony
centuries, and whare, in the castle of Edinburgh, is still preserved the
sacred regalia, with which it migh no hae been unapropos to hae graced
his royal head and hand amidst the gratifying pageantry o' a Scotch
coronation. Sure I am that North Britain has never been honored publicly
wi' a royal visit.&mdash;Whether ony branch o' the present reigning family
hae been there incognita they best ken themselves."
</p>
<p>
"You seem to have forgot," observed Tallyho, "the visit of the Duke of
Cumberland to Scotland in the year 1745."
</p>
<p>
"Begging your pardon for setting you right in that particular," answered
the cynic, with a most significant expression of countenance, "that,
Sir, was not a visit, but a visitation!"
</p>
<p>
"Appropriate enough," whispered Dashall to Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"Augh, boderation to nice distinctions!" exclaimed O'Shaughnessy; "here,
Mister Suttler be after tipping over anoder half quartern of the cratur,
wid which to drink success to the royal visitant."
</p>
<p>
"And that the company may participate in the gratifying expression of
attachment to their Sovereign, Landlord," said Dashall, "let the glass
go round."
</p>
<p>
"Testifying our regard for the Sovereign," resumed the Northern, "it
canna be understood that we include a' the underlings o' Government. We
ought, as in duty bound, to venerate and obey the maister o' the house;
bat it is <span class="pagenum">[337]</span> by no means necessary that we should pay a similar
respect to his ox and his ass, his man-servant and his maid-servant.
May be, had he been at hame on a late occasion o' melancholy solemnity,
blood wadna hae been spilt, and mickle dool and sorrow wad hae been
avoided."
</p>
<p>
"We perfectly understand your allusion," said one from the group of
Life-guardsmen: "Of us now present there were none implicated in the
unfortunate occurrences either of that day or a subsequent one: yet we
must not silently hear our comrades traduced&mdash;perhaps then it may be as
well to drop the subject."
</p>
<p>
"I canna think o' relinquishing a topic 0' discourse," answered the
Northern, "replete wi' mickle interest, merely at your suggestion; it
may be ye did your duty in obeying the commands, on that lamentable
occasion, O' your superior officers, and it is to be hoped that the duty
O' the country, towards those with whom originated the mischief, will
not be forgotten; there is already on record against the honour 0' your
corps a vera serious verdick."
</p>
<p>
Here the Life-guardsmen spontaneously started up; but the immediate
interposition of Dashall averted me impending storm; while Tallyho,
imitating the generosity of his Cousin, ordered the circulation once
more of the bottle, to Unanimity betwixt the military and the people.
Harmony thus restored, the two friends took their leave, amidst the
grateful acknowledgments of the company, O'Shaughnessy swearing on
their departure, that doubtless the two strangers were begot in Ireland,
although they might have come over to England to be born! While the
pertinacious Northern observed, that appearances were aften deceitful,
although, to be sure, the twa friends had vera mickle the manners 0'
perfectly well-bred gentlemen, and seem'd, forbye, to hae a proper sense
o' national honor.
</p>
<p>
Proceeding into Whitehall, Tallyho much admired the statue-like figures
of the mounted sentries in the recesses by the gate of the Horse-guards;
the relief had just approached; the precision of retirement of the one
party, and advance to its post of the other: the interesting appearance
of the appropriately caparisoned and steady demeanour of the horses,
and their instinctive knowledge of military duty, excited deservedly
prolonged attention,
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[338]</span> "One would think," said Tallyho, "that these noble animals are
really actuated by reasoning faculties."
</p>
<p>
"Hereafter," replied Dashall, "you will still more incline to this
opinion, when we have an opportunity of being present on a cavalry
field-day in Hyde Park, where manoeuvre will appear to have attained its
acme of perfection, as much from the wonderful docility of the horse as
the discipline of the rider."{l}
</p>
<p>
"But hold, who have we here?&mdash;Our friend Sparkle, gazing about him with
an eye of inquisitive incertitude, as if in search of lost property."
</p>
<p>
As his two friends approached, he seemed bewildered in the labyrinth
of conjecture.&mdash;"I have lost my horse!" he exclaimed, in answer to the
inquiry of Dashall. "Having occasion to stop half an hour at Drummond's,
I gave the animal in charge of an Israelite urchin, and now neither are
to be seen."
</p>
<p>
Casting a look down the street, they at last discerned the Jew lad,
quickly, yet carefully leading the horse along, with two boys mounted on
its back. Thoroughly instructed in the maxim&mdash;Get money, honestly if
you can, but get it by any means! young Moses had made the most of the
present opportunity, by letting out the horse, at a penny a ride, from
Charing Cross to the Horse Guards; this, by his own confession, was
the fifteenth trip! Sparkle, highly exasperated, was about to apply the
discipline of the whip to the shoulders of the thrifty speculator, when
Tallyho, interceding in his behalf, he was released, with a suitable
admonition.
</p>
<pre>
     1 Not long since some cavalry horses, deemed "unfit for
     further service," were sold at Tattersal's. Of one of these
     a Miller happened to be the purchaser. Subservient now to
     the ignoble purposes of burthen, the horse one day was
     led,'with a sack of flour on his back, to the next market-
     town; there while the Miller entered a house for a few
     moments, and the animal quietly waited at the door, a
     squadron of dragoons drew up in an adjacent street, forming
     by sound of trumpet; the instant that the Miller's horse
     heard the well-known signal, it started off with as much
     celerity as its burthen admitted, and, to the great
     amusement of the troop, and astonishment of the spectators,
     took its station in the ranks, dressing in line, with the
     accustomed precision of an experienced veteran in the
     service; and it was with considerable difficulty that the
     Miller, who had now hastened to the spot, could induce the
     animal to relinquish its military ardour, to which it still
     appeared to cling with renewed and fond pertinacity!
</pre>
<p>
Sparkle, mounting his recovered charger, left his <span class="pagenum">[339]</span> pedestrian
friends for the present, to continue their excursion; who, proceeding up
St. Martin's Lane, and admiring that noble edifice, the Church, reached,
without other remarkable occurrence, the quietude of Leicester Square.
</p>
<p>
Close by is Barker's Panorama, an object of attraction too prominent to
be passed without inspection. They now entered, and Tallyho stood mute
with delight at the astonishing effect of the perspective; while, as if
by the powers of enchantment, he seemed to have been transported into
other regions. Amidst scenes of rich sublimity, in the centre of a vast
amphitheatre, bounded only by the distant horizon, far remote from the
noisy bustle of the Metropolis, he gave full scope to his imagination;
and after an hour of pleasing reverie, left the fascinating delusion
with evident reluctance.
</p>
<p>
Emerging once more into the gay world, the two associates, in search
of Real Life in London, proceeded through Covent Garden Market, where
fruit, flowers, and exotics in profusion, invite alike the eye and the
appetite.
</p>
<p>
Onwards they reached the classic ground of Drury, "Where Catherine
Street descends into the Strand."
</p>
<p>
"I never," said the Hon. Tom Dashall, "pass this spot without a feeling
of veneration&mdash;the scenes of "olden times" rise on my view, and the
shades of Garrick, and our late loss, and not less illustrious
Sheridan, flit before me! This was then, as now, the seat of Cyprian
indulgence&mdash;the magnet of sensual attraction, where feminine youth and
beauty in their most fascinating and voluptuous forms were let out by
the unprincipled procuress, and the shrines of Venus and Apollo invited
the votaries of each to nocturnal sacrifice.{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 The avenue to the boxes of Drury Lane Theatre was, in the
     time of Garrick, through Vinegar Yard. In this passage an
     old spider, better known, perhaps, by the name of a
     Procuress, had spread her web, alias, opened a Bagnio, and
     obtained a plentiful living by preying on those who
     unfortunately or imprudently fell into her clutches. Those
     who are not unacquainted with haddocks, will understand the
     loose fish alluded to, who beset her doors, and accosted
     with smiles or insults every one that passed. It happened
     that a noble Lord, in his way to the theatre, with his two
     daughters under his arm, was most grossly attacked by this
     band of "flaming ministers." He immediately went behind the
     scenes, and insisted on seeing Mr. Garrick, to whom he
     represented his case, and so roused the vengeance of the
     little Manager, that he instantly, full of wrath, betook
     himself to this unholy Sybil:&mdash;

     "Twin-child of Cacus; Vulcan was their sire, Full offspring
     both of healthless fume and fire!"
</pre>
<pre>
     Finding her at the mouth of her cavern, he quickly gave veut
     to his rage in the most buskin'd strain, and concluded by
     swearing that he would have her ousted. To this assault she
     was not backward in reply, but soon convinced him that she
     was much more powerful in abusive language than our Roscius,
     though he had recourse in his speech to Milton's "hell-born
     bitch," and other phrases of similar celebrity, whilst she
     entirely depended on her own natural resources. Those to
     whom this oratory is not new, have no need of our reporting
     any of it; and those to whom it is a perfect mystery, boast
     a "state the more gracious," and are the more happy in their
     ignorance. None of this rhapsody, however, although teeming
     with blasphemy and abuse, had any effect on Garrick, and he
     would have remained unmoved had she not terminated in the
     following manner, which so excited the laughter of the
     collected mob, and disconcerted "the soul of Richard,"
     that, without another word to say, he hastily took shelter
     in the theatre. Putting her arms akimbo, and letting down
     each side of her mouth with wonderful expression of
     contempt, she exclaimed&mdash;"You whipper snapper! you oust me!
     You be d&mdash;&mdash;-d!    My house is as good as your's&mdash;aye, and
     better too.    I can come into your's whenever I like, and
     see the best that you can do for a shilling; but d&mdash;&mdash;-me if
     you, or any body else, shall come into mine for less than a
     fifteen-penny negus."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[340]</span> "This street and neighbourhood was wont to exhibit, nightly,
a melancholy proof of early infamy. Here might be seen a prolonged
succession of juvenile voluptuaries, females, many of them under
fourteen years of age, offering themselves to indiscriminate
prostitution, in a state verging on absolute nudity, alluring the
passengers, by every seductive wile, to the haunts of depravity, from
which retreat was seldom effected without pecuniary exaction, and
frequently accompanied by personal violence. The nuisance has been
partly abated, but entirely to remove it would be a task of more
difficult accomplishment than that of cleansing the Augean stable, and
would baffle all the labours of Hercules!"
</p>
<p>
"This fact," observed Tallyho, "throws an indelible stain on
metropolitan police."
</p>
<p>
"Not so," answered his companion, "scarce a day passes without groups of
these unfortunates being held before a magistrate, and humanely disposed
of in various ways, with the view of preventing a recurrence to vicious
habits,&mdash;but in vain;&mdash;the stain is more attributed to the depraved
nature of man, who first seduces, and then casts off <span class="pagenum">[341]</span> to infamy
and indigence the unhappy victim of credulity. Many of these wretched
girls would, in all probability, gladly have abstained from the career
of vice, if, on their first fall, they had experienced the consoling
protection of parents or friends;&mdash;but, shut out from home,&mdash;exiled from
humanity,&mdash;divested of character, and without resources,&mdash;no choice is
left, other than mendicity or prostitution!"{1}
</p>
<p>
The sombre reflections occasioned by these remarks gradually gave way to
those of a more enlivening hue, as the two friends proceeded along the
Strand. The various display, at the tradesmen's shop windows, of useful
and ornamental articles,&mdash;the continued bustle of the street,&mdash;the
throng of passengers of every description, hurrying on in the activity
of business, or more leisurely lounging their way under the impulse of
curiosity,&mdash;the endless succession of new faces, and frequent occurrence
of interesting incident;&mdash;these united in forming an inexhaustible fund
of amusement and admiration.
</p>
<pre>
     1 "Hatton Garden.&mdash;On Saturday, no less than fifteen
     unfortunate girls, all elegantly attired, were placed at the
     bar, charged by Cadby, the street-keeper on the Foundling
     Estate, with loitering about the neighbourhood for their
     nocturnal purposes. The constable stated, that repeated
     complaints had been made to him by many of the inhabitants,
     of the disgraceful practice of vast numbers of frail ones,
     who resort every night to Brunswick Square. He had been
     therefore instructed to endeavour to suppress the nuisance.
     About twelve o'clock on Friday night, while perambulating
     the district, he found the fifteen prisoners at the bar in
     Brunswick Square, at their usual pursuits, and all of them
     were in the act of picking up gentlemen. He procured
     assistance, and they were taken into custody, and conveyed
     to the watch-house.

     None of the prisoners could deny the charge, but expressed
     great contrition at being under the painful necessity of
     procuring their subsistence in so disgraceful a manner. They
     were examined individually, by the magistrates, as to the
     origin that brought them to disgrace. Some, from their
     admission, were farmers' daughters, and had been decoyed
     from their relatives, and brought to London, and
     subsequently deserted by their seducers. Some were nursery-
     maids&mdash;others, girls seduced from boarding schools. Their
     tales were truly distressing&mdash;some had only been six months
     in such infamy, others twelve months, and some two years and
     upwards.

     The worthy magistrate, with much feeling, admonished them on
     the evil course they were following, and pointed out the
     means still left for them to return to the paths of virtue;
     and on their severally promising never to appear again in
     that quarter, they were discharged."
</pre>
<p>
Passing through Temple Bar, "Once more," said <span class="pagenum">[342]</span> Dashall, "we enter
the dominions of another Sovereign,&mdash;the Monarch of the City,&mdash;than
whom there is none more tenacious of the rights and immunities of
his subjects. Professing a strictly civil government, and consequent
hostility to military interference, it does not always happen that the
regal sway of the East harmonizes with that of the West, and the limited
reign of the former is generally most popular when most in opposition
to that of the latter. Several important events have occurred wherein a
late patriotic Right Honourable Chief Magistrate has had the opportunity
of manifesting a zealous, firm, and determined attachment to the
privileges of the community: the good wishes of his fellow-citizens have
accompanied his retirement, and his private and public worth will be
long held in deserved estimation."
</p>
<p>
Turning up the Old Bailey, and passing, with no pleasing sensations,
that structure in front of which so many human beings expiate their
offences with their lives, without, in any degree, the frequency of
the dreadful example lessening the perpetration of crime,&mdash;"The crowd
thickens," exclaimed the 'Squire; and advancing into Smithfield, a
new scene opened on the view of the astonished Tallyho. An immense and
motley crowd was wedged together in the open space of the market, which
was surrounded by booths and shows of every description, while the
pavement was rendered nearly impassable by a congregated multitude,
attracted by the long line of stalls, exhibiting, in ample redundancy,
the gorgeously gilt array of ginger-bread monarchs, savory spice-nuts,
toys for children and those of elder growth, and the numerous other
<i>et cetera</i> of Bartholomew Fair, which at that moment the Lord Mayor
of London, with accustomed state and formality, was in the act of
proclaiming.
</p>
<p>
A more dissonant uproar now astounded the ears of Bob than ever issued
from the hounds at falt in the field or at variance in the kennel! The
prolonged stunning and vociferous acclamation of the mob, accompanied
by the deeply sonorous clangor of the gong&mdash;the shrill blast of the
trumpet&mdash;the hoarse-resounding voices of the mountebanks, straining
their lungs to the pitch of extremity, through speaking tubes&mdash;the
screams of women and children, and the universal combination of discord,
announced the termination of the Civic Sovereign's performance in the
drama; "the revelry now had began," <span class="pagenum">[343]</span> and all was obstreperous
uproar, and "confusion worse confounded."
</p>
<p>
In the vortex of the vast assemblage, the Hon. Tom Dashall and his
Cousin were more closely hemmed in than they probably would have been at
the rout of female distinction, where inconvenience is the order of the
night, and pressure, to the dread of suffocation, the criterion of rank
and fashion. Borne on the confluent tide, retreat was impracticable;
alternately then, stationary and advancing with the multitude, as it
urged its slow and undulating progress; or paused at the attractions of
Wombwell and Gillman's rival menageries&mdash;the equestrian shows of Clark
and Astley&mdash;the theatres of Richardson and Gyngell, graced by the
promenade of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> and lure of female nudity&mdash;the young
giantess&mdash;the dwarfs&mdash;and the accomplished lady, who, born without arms,
cuts out watch-papers with her toes, and takes your likeness with her
teeth!&mdash;Amidst these and numerous other seductive impediments to their
progress, our pedestrians, resisting alike temptation and invitation,
penetrated the mass of spectators, and gained an egress at Long Lane,
uninjured in person, and undamaged in property, "save and except" the
loss, by Bob, of a shoe, and the rent frock of his honourable Cousin.
To repair the one and replace the other was now the predominant
consideration. By fortunate proximity to a descendant of St. Crispin,
the latter object was speedily effected; but the difficulty of
finding, in that neighbourhood, a knight of the thimble, appearing
insurmountable, the two friends pursued their course, Dashall drawing
under his arm the shattered skirts of his garment, until they reached
Playhouse Yard, in Upper Whitecross Street, St. Luke's, to which they
had been previously directed, the epitome of Monmouth Street, chiefly
inhabited by tailors and old clothes retailers, where purchase and
repair are equally available.
</p>
<p>
Entering a shop occupied by an intelligent Scotch tailor, who, with
his son, was busily employed in making up black cloth and kerseymere
waistcoats, his spouse, a native of Edinburgh, with a smile of
complacency and avidity of utterance that strongly indicated a view to
the main chance, put her usual inquiry:
</p>
<p>
"What is your wull, Gentlemen&mdash;what wad you please to want?"
</p>
<p>
"My good lady," answered Dashall, "we would be <span class="pagenum">[344]</span> glad to accept the
services of your husband," exhibiting at same time the rent skirts of
his frock. "This accident was sustained in passing, or rather in being
squeezed through the Fair; my friend too, experienced a trifling loss;
but, as it has been replaced, I believe that he does not require present
amendment."
</p>
<p>
The materials destined to form the black waistcoats were then put aside,
while the northern adept in the exercise of the needle proceeded
to operate on the fractured garment; and a coat being supplied, <i>ad
interim</i>, Tom and his friend accepted the "hospitable invitation of the
guid wife, and seated themselves with unhesitating sociability.
</p>
<p>
"And sae ye hae been to the Fair, gentlemen?" "We have, madam," said
Dashall, "and unintentionally so; we were not, until on the spot, aware
of any such exhibition, and got within its vortex just as the Lord Mayor
had licensed, by proclamation, the commencement of this annual scene of
idleness, riot and dissipation!"
</p>
<p>
"Hoot awa, Sir, ye wadna wish to deprive us o' our amusements; poor
folks dinna often enjoy pleasure, and why should na they hae a wee bit
o' it now and then, as weel as the rich?"
</p>
<p>
"I know not, my good lady," exclaimed Bon, "that I can altogether
assimilate with your's my ideas of pleasure; if it consists in being
pressed nearly to death by a promiscuous rabble, in attempts on your
pocket, shoes trod off your feet by the formidable iron-cased soles of a
drayman's ponderous sandals, to say nothing of the pleasing effect thus
produced upon your toes, and in having the coat torn off from your back,
I would freely resign to the admirers of such pleasure the full benefit
of its enjoyment."
</p>
<p>
"Accidents wull happen ony where and in ony situation," replied the
garrulous wife; "ye may be thankfu', gentlemen, that its nae waur,&mdash;and,
for the matter o' the rent frock, my guid man wull repair it in sic a
way that the disaster wull no be seen, and the coat wull look as weel as
ever."
</p>
<p>
The promise was verified; the reparation was made with equal neatness
and celerity; something beyond the required remuneration was given; and
Dashall inquiring if the worthy dame of <i>Auld Reekie</i> would take a drop
of cordial, the friendly offer was accepted, and the glass of <span class="pagenum">[345]</span>
good fellowship having been drank, and civilities interchanged, the
strangers departed.
</p>
<p>
They were now in Whitecross Street, where sojourned their acquaintance
of the morning, the distressed Poet; and, from the accuracy of
description, had no difficulty in ascertaining his place of residence.
</p>
<p>
It was in a public-house; a convenient lodging for the forlorn
being, who, exiled from friendship, and unconnected by any ties of
consanguinity, can dress his scanty meal by a gratuitous fire, and where
casual generosity may sometimes supply him with a draught of Hanbury's
exhilarating beverage.
</p>
<p>
At the bar, directly facing the street door, the strangers, on inquiring
for the Poet by name, were directed by the landlord, with a sarcastical
expression of countenance, to "the first floor <i>down the chimney</i>!"
while the Hostess, whose demeanour perfectly accorded with that of
the well-manner'd gentlewoman, politely interfered, and, shewing the
parlour, sent a domestic to acquaint her lodger that he was wanted below
stairs.
</p>
<p>
The summons was instantaneously obeyed; but as the parlour precluded the
opportunity of private conversation, being partly occupied by clamorous
butchers, with whom this street abounds to redundancy, the Poet had no
other alternative than that of inviting the respectable visitants to
his attic, or, as the Landlord facetiously named the lofty domicile, his
first floor down the chimney!
</p>
<p>
Real Life in London must be seen, to be believed. The Hon. Tom Dashall
and his friend Tallyho were reared in the lap of luxury, and never
until now formed an adequate conception of the distressing privations
attendant on suffering humanity.
</p>
<p>
With a dejection of spirits evidently occasioned by the humiliating
necessity of ushering his polished friends into the wretched asylum of
penury, the Poet led the way with tardy reluctancy, while his visitors
regretted every step of ascent, under the appalling circumstance of
giving pain to adversity; yet they felt that to recede would be more
indelicate than to advance.
</p>
<p>
The apartment which they now entered seemed a lumber room, for the
reception of superfluous or unserviceable furniture, containing not
fewer than eleven decayed and mutilated chairs of varied description;
and the limited space, to make the most of it in a pecuniary point of
view, <span class="pagenum">[346]</span> was encroached upon by three uncurtained beds, of most
impoverished appearance,&mdash;while, exhibiting the ravages of time in
divers fractures, the dingy walls and ceiling, retouched by the trowel
in many places with a lighter shade of repairing material, bore no unapt
resemblance to the Pye-bald Horse in Chiswell-street! Calculating on its
utility and probable future use, the builder of the mansion had given
to this room the appendage of a chimney, but evidently it had for many
years been unconscious of its usual accompaniment, fire. Two windows had
originally admitted the light of heaven, but to reduce the duty, one
was internally blocked up, while externally uniformity was preserved. A
demolished pane of glass in the remaining window, close to which stood
a small dilapidated table, gave ingress to a current of air; the
convenient household article denominated a clothes-horse, stood against
the wall; and several parallel lines of cord were stretched across the
room, on which to hang wet linen, a garret being considered of free
access to all the house, and the comfort or health of its occupant held
in utter derision and contempt!
</p>
<p>
Here then,&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "In the worst Inn's worst room, with cobwebs hung,
          The walls of plaster and the floors of dung,"
</pre>
<p>
entered Dashall and his Cousin Tallyho. The latter familiarly seating
himself on the ricketty remains of what had once been an arm-chair, but
now a cripple, having lost one of its legs, the precarious equilibrium
gave way under the unaccustomed shock of the contact, and the 'Squire
came to the ground, to his no small surprise, the confusion of the poet,
and amusement of Dashall!
</p>
<p>
With many apologies for the awkwardness of their very humble
accommodation, and grateful expression of thanks for the honour
conferred upon him, the Poet replaced Tallyho in a firmer seat, and a
silence of some few moments ensued, the two friends being at a loss in
what manner to explain, and the Poet unwilling to inquire the object of
their visit.
</p>
<p>
Dashall began at last, by observing that in pursuit of the knowledge of
Real Life in London, he and his accompanying friend had met with many
incidents both ludicrous and interesting; but that in the present
instance their visit was rather influenced by sympathy than <span class="pagenum">[347]</span>
curiosity, and that where they could be serviceable to the interest of
merit in obscurity, they always should be happy in the exercise of a
duty so perfectly congenial with their feelings.
</p>
<p>
Many years had elapsed since the person, to whom these remarks were
addressed, had heard the voice of consolation, and its effect was
instantaneous; his usual sombre cast of countenance became brightened by
the glow of cheerful animation, and he even dwelt on the subject of his
unfortunate circumstances with jocularity:
</p>
<p>
"The elevated proximity of a garret," he observed, "to the sublimer
regions, has often been resorted to as the <i>roost of genius</i>; and why
should I, of the most slender, if any, literary pretensions, complain?
And yet my writings, scattered amongst the various fugitive periodical
publications of this and our sister island, if collected together, would
form a very voluminous compilation."
</p>
<p>
"I have always understood," said Bob, "that the quality, not the
quantum, constituted the fame of an author's productions."
</p>
<p>
"True, Sir," answered the Poet; "and I meant not the vanity of
arrogating to myself any merit from my writings, with reference either
to quantum or quality. I alluded to the former, as merely proving the
inefficacy of mental labour in realizing the necessaries of life to an
author whom celebrity declines acknowledging. Similarly situated, it
would appear was the Dutchman mentioned by the late Doctor Walcot,
</p>
<pre>
          "My Broder is te poet, look,
          As all te world must please,
          For he heb wrote, py Got, a book
          So big as all this cheese!"
</pre>
<p>
"On the other hand, Collins, Hammond, and Gray, wrote each of them but
little, yet their names will descend to posterity!&mdash;And had Gray, of his
poems the <i>Bard</i>, and the <i>Elegy in a Country Church Yard</i>, written
only one, and written nothing else, he had required no other or better
passport to immortality!"{1}
</p>
<pre>
     1 Of that great and multitudinous writer, Doctor Samuel
     Johnson, the following anecdote is told: "Being one morning
     in the library at Buckingham House honoured with the
     presence of Royalty, the King, his late Majesty, inquired
     why he, (Mr. Johnson) did not continue to write.    "May it
     please your Majesty," answered the Doctor, "I think I have
     written enough."&mdash;"I should have thought so too," his
     Majesty replied, "if, Doctor Johnson, you had not written so
     well."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[348]</span> In this opinion the visitants, who were both well conversant with
our native literature, readily acquiesced.
</p>
<p>
"Have you never," asked Dashall, "thought of publishing a volume by
subscription?"
</p>
<p>
"I meditated such intention," answered the Poet, "not long ago; drew
up the necessary Prospectus, with a specimen of the Poetry, and
perambulated the Metropolis in search of patronage. In some few
instances I was successful, and, though limited the number, yet the high
respectability of my few Subscribers gave me inexpressible satisfaction;
several of our nobility honoured me with their names, and others, my
patrons, were of the very first class of literature. Nevertheless,
I encountered much contumelious reception; and after an irksome
and unavailing perseverance of a month's continuance, I was at last
compelled to relinquish all hope of success.
</p>
<p>
"Having then on my list the name of a very worthy Alderman who lately
filled the Civic Chair with honour to himself and advantage to his
fellow-citizens, I submitted my prospectus in an evil hour to another
Alderman, a baronet, of this here and that there notoriety!
</p>
<p>
"Waiting in his Banking-house the result of my application, he
condescended to stalk forth from the holy of holies, his inner room,
with the lofty demeanour of conscious importance, when, in the presence
of his Clerks and others, doubtless to their great edification and
amusement, the following colloquy ensued, bearing in his hand my unlucky
Prospectus, with a respectful epistle which had accompanied it:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Are you the writer," he asked in a majesterial tone, "of this here
letter?"
</p>
<p>
"I am, Sir W*****m, unfortunately!"
</p>
<p>
"Then," he continued, "you may take them there papers back again, I have
no time to read Prospectuses, and so Mister Poet my compliments, and
good morning to you!!!"
</p>
<p>
"These literally were his words; and such was the astounding effect they
produced on my mind, that, although I had meant to have passed through
the Royal Exchange, I yet, in the depth of my reverie, wandered I knew
not where, and, before recovering my recollection, found myself in the
centre of London Bridge!"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[349]</span> The detail of this fact, so characteristic of rude, ungentlemanly
manners, and the barbarian ignorance of this great man of little soul,
excited against him, with Dashall and his friend, a mingled feeling of
ridicule, contempt and reprobation!
</p>
<p>
"Real Life in London still!" exclaimed Talltho; "intellect and indigence
in a garret, and wealth and ignorance in a banking-house!&mdash;I would
at least have given him, in deficiency of other means, the wholesome
castigation of reproof."
</p>
<p>
"I did," said the Poet, "stung to the quick by such unmerited contumely,
I retired to my attic, and produced a philippic named the Recantation:
I cannot accommodate you at present with a copy of the Poem, but the
concluding stanzas I can repeat from memory:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "C****s, thy house in Lombard Street
          Affords thee still employment meet,
          Thy consequence retaining;
          For there thy Partners and thy Clerks
          Must listen to thy sage remarks,
          Subservient, uncomplaining.

          And rob'd in Aldermanic gown,
          With look and language all thy own,
          Thou mak'st thy hearers stare,
          When this here cause, so wisely tried,
          Thou put'st with self-applause aside,
          To wisely try that there.

          Nor can thy brother Cits forget
          When thou at civic banquet sate,
          And ask'd of Heaven a boon,
          A toast is call'd, on thee all eyes
          Intent, when peals of laughter rise&mdash;
          A speedy peace and soon!

          Nor yet orthography nor grammar,
          Vain effort on thy pate to hammer,
          Impregnable that fort is!
          Witness thy toast again,&mdash;Three Cs;
          For who would think that thou by these
          Meant Cox, and King, and Curtis
          C****s, though scant thy sense, yet Heaven
          To thee the better boon hast given
          Or wealth&mdash;then sense despise,
          And deem not Fate's decrees amiss,
          For still "where ignorance is bliss
          'Tis folly to be wise!"
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[350]</span> "Bravo!" exclaimed Dashall; "re-issue your Prospectus, my friend,
and we will accelerate, with our best interest and influence, the
publication of your volume. Let it be dedicated to the Hon. Tom Dashall
and his Cousin Bob Tallyho. In the meanwhile, accept this trifle, as a
complimentary <i>douceur</i> uniformly given on such occasions; and, amidst
the varied scenes of Real Life in London, I shall frequently recur to
the present as the most gratifying to my feelings."
</p>
<pre>
          "By this the sun was out of sight,
          And darker gloamin brought the night."
</pre>
<p>
The benevolent associates now departed, pleased with the occurrences of
the day, and, more than all, with the last, wherein the opportunity
was afforded them of extending consolation and relief to genius in
adversity!<span class="pagenum">[351]</span>

    CHAPTER XXII
</h2>
<pre>
          ........"Mark!
          He who would cut the knot that does entwine
          And link two loving hearts in unison,
          May have man's form; but at his birth, be sure on't,
          Some devil thrust sweet nature's hand aside
          Ere she had pour'd her balm within his breast,
          To warm his gross and earthly mould with pity.

          .......I know what 'tis
          When worldly knaves step in with silver beards,
          To poison bliss, and pluck young souls asunder."
</pre>
<p>
TOM and his Cousin were surprised the next morning by a visit from
Mr. Mortimer and his friend Merrywell, whose dismal features and long
visages plainly indicated some unpleasant disaster, and Tom began to
fear blame would be attached to them for leaving his party at Darkhouse
Lane.
</p>
<p>
"Pray," said Merrywell, "can you tell me where to find your friend
Sparkle?"
</p>
<p>
"Indeed," replied Dashall, a little relieved by this question, "I am not
Sparkle's keeper; but pray be seated&mdash;what is the matter, is it a duel,
do you want a second?&mdash;I know he is a good shot."
</p>
<p>
"This levity, Sir," said Mortimer, "is not to be borne. The honour of a
respectable family is at stake, and must be satisfied. No doubt you,
as his very oldest friend, know where he is; and I desire you will
immediately inform me, or&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Sir," said Dashall, who was as averse as unused to be desired by any
person&mdash;"do you know whom you address, and that I am in my own house?
if you do, you have certainly discarded all propriety of conduct and
language before you cross'd the threshold."
</p>
<p>
"Gentlemen," said Merrywell, "perhaps some explanation is really
necessary here. My friend Mortimer speaks under agonized feelings,
for which, I am sure, your good sense will make every allowance. Miss
Mortimer&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Miss Mortimer," exclaimed Dashall, rising from his <span class="pagenum">[352]</span> seat, "you
interest me strongly, say, what of Miss Mortimer?"
</p>
<p>
"Alas," said Mortimer, evidently endeavouring to suppress emotions which
appeared to agitate his whole frame, and absorb every mental faculty,
"we are unable to account for her absence, and strongly suspect she is
in company with your friend Sparkle&mdash;can you give us any information
relative to either of them?"
</p>
<p>
Dashall assured them he knew nothing of the fugitives, but that he
would certainly make every inquiry in his power, if possible to find
out Sparkle. Upon which they departed, though not without hinting they
expected Tom had the power of making a search more effectually than
either Mortimer or Merrywell.
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" said Tom to Tallyho, "this absence of Sparkle means something
more than I can at present conceive; and it appears that we must
now venture forth in search of our guide. I hope he has taken a good
direction himself."
</p>
<p>
"Mortimer appears hurt," continued Bob, "and I can scarcely wonder at
it."
</p>
<p>
"It is a trifle in high life now-a-days," replied Dashall, "and my life
for it we shall obtain some clue to his mode of operation before the
day is out. Love is a species of madness, and oftentimes induces
extraordinary movements. I have discovered its existence in his breast
for some time past, and if he is really with the lady, I wonder myself
that he has not given some sort of intimation; though I know he is very
cautious in laying his plans, and very tenacious of admitting too many
persons to know his intentions, for fear of some indiscreet friend
unintentionally frustrating his designs."
</p>
<p>
"I apprehend we shall have a wild-goose chase of it," rejoined Bob.
</p>
<p>
"It serves however," continued Tom, "to diversify our peregrinations;
and if it is his pleasure to be in love, we will endeavour to chase
pleasure in pursuit of the Lover, and if guided by honourable motives,
which I cannot doubt, we will wish him all the success he can wish
himself, only regretting that we are deprived of his agreeable company.
</p>
<pre>
          "Still free as air the active mind will rove,
          And search out proper objects for its love;
          But that once fix'd, 'tis past the pow'r of art
          To chase the dear idea from the heart.
          'Tis liberty of choice that sweetens life,
          Makes the glad husband and the happy wife."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[353]</span> "But come, let us forth and see how the land lies; many persons
obtain all their notoriety from an elopement; it makes a noise in the
world, and even though frequently announced in our newspapers under
fictitious titles, the parties soon become known and are recollected
ever after; and some even acquire fame by the insertion of a paragraph
announcing an elopement, in which they insinuate that themselves are
parties; so that an elopement in high life may be considered as one of
the sure roads to popularity."
</p>
<p>
"But not always a safe one," replied Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Life is full of casualties," rejoined Dashall, "and you are by
this time fully aware that it requires something almost beyond human
foresight to continue in the line of safety, while you are in pursuit of
Real Life in London. Though it may fairly be said, 'That all the world's
a stage, and all the men and women merely passengers,' still they have
their inside and their outside places, and each man in his time meets
with strange adventures. It may also very properly be termed a Camera
Obscura, reflecting not merely trees, sign-posts, houses, &amp;c. but
the human heart in all its folds, its feelings, its passions, and its
motives. In it you may perceive conceit flirting its fan&mdash;arrogance
adjusting its cravat&mdash;pedantry perverting its dictionary&mdash;vacuity
humming a tune&mdash;vanity humming his neighbour&mdash;cunning shutting his eyes
while listening to a pedagogue&mdash;and credulity opening his eyes and ears,
willing and anxious to be deceived and duped."
</p>
<p>
"It is a strange world, indeed," said Tallyho; "and of all that I have
ever heard or seen, this London of your's is the most extraordinary
part."
</p>
<p>
"Yes,&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "This world is a well-cover'd table,
          Where guests are promiscuously set;
          We all eat as long as we're able,
          And scramble for what we can get&mdash;"
</pre>
<p>
answered his Cousin; "in fact, it is like every thing, and at the same
time like nothing&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[354]</span>
</p>
<pre>
          "The world is all nonsense and noise,
          Fantoccini, or Ombres Chinoises,
          Mere pantomime mummery
          Puppet-show flummery;
          A magical lantern, confounding the sight;

          Like players or puppets, we move
          On the wires of ambition and love;
          Poets write wittily,
          Maidens look prettily,
          'Till death drops the curtain
                &mdash;all's over&mdash;good night!"
</pre>
<p>
By this time they were at Long's, where, upon inquiry, all trace of
Sparkle had been lost for two days. All was mystery and surprise, not so
much that he should be absent, as that his servant could give no account
of him, which was rather extraordinary. Tom ascertained, however, that
no suspicion appeared to have been excited as to Miss Mortimer, and,
with commendable discretion, avoided expressing a word which could
create such an idea, merely observing, that most likely he had taken an
unexpected trip into the country, and would be heard of before the day
was out.
</p>
<p>
On leaving Long's however they were met again by Mortimer in breathless
anxiety, evidently labouring under some new calamity.
</p>
<p>
"I am glad I have found you," said he, addressing himself to Dashall;
"for I am left in this d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d wilderness of a place without a friend
to speak to."
</p>
<p>
"How," inquired Ton, "what the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l is the matter with you?"
</p>
<p>
"Why, you must know that Merry well is gone&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Gone&mdash;where to?"
</p>
<p>
"To&mdash;to&mdash;zounds, I've forgot the name of the people; but two genteel
looking fellows just now very genteely told him he was wanted, and must
come."
</p>
<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, and he told me to find you out, and let you know that he must
become a bencher; and, without more todo, walked away with his new
friends, leaving me forlorn enough. My Sister run away, my Uncle run
after her&mdash;Sparkle absent, and Merrywell&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"In the hands of the Nab-men&mdash;I see it all clear enough; and you have
given a very concise, but comprehensive picture of your own situation;
but don't despair, man, you will yet find all right, be assured; put
yourself under my guidance, let the world wag as it will; it is useless
to torment yourself with things you cannot prevent or cure.
</p>
<p>
"The right end of life is to live and be jolly."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[355]</span> Mortimer scarcely knew how to relish this advice, and seemed to
doubt within himself whether it was meant satirically or feelingly, till
Dashall whispered in his ear a caution not to betray the circumstances
that had transpired, for his Sister's sake. "But," continued he, "I
never suffer these things, which are by no means uncommon in London,
to interfere with my pursuits, though we are all somewhat at a loss.
However, as the post is in by this time, some news may be expected, and
we will call at home before we proceed any further.&mdash;Where do you think
the Colonel is gone to?"
</p>
<p>
"Heaven only knows," replied Mortimer; "the whole family is in an uproar
of surmise and alarm,&mdash;what may be the end of it I know not."
</p>
<p>
"A pretty breeze Master Sparkle has kick'd up, indeed," continued Tom;
"but I have for some time noticed an alteration in him. He always was
a gay trump, and whenever I find him seriously inclined, I suspect
some mischief brewing; for rapid transitions always wear portentous
appearances, and your serious files are generally sly dogs. My life
for it they have stolen a march upon your Uncle, queered some country
Parson, and are by this time snugly stowed away in the harbour of
matrimony. As for Merrywell, I dare be sworn his friends will take care
of him."
</p>
<p>
Expectation was on tiptoe as Dashall broke the seal of a letter that
was handed to him on arrival at home. Mortimer was on the fidget, and
Tallyho straining his neck upon the full stretch of anxiety to hear
the news, when Dashall burst into a laugh, but in which neither of the
others could join in consequence of not knowing the cause of it. In a
few minutes however the mystery was in some degree explained.
</p>
<p>
"Here," said Tom, "is news&mdash;extraordinary news&mdash;an official dispatch
from head-quarters, but without any information as to where the tents
are pitched. It is but a short epistle." He then read aloud,
</p>
<p>
"Dear Dashall,
</p>
<p>
"Please inform the Mortimer family and friends that all's well.
</p>
<p>
Your's truly,
</p>
<p>
C. Sparkle."
</p>
<p>
Then handing the laconic epistle to Mortimer&mdash;"I trust," said he, "you
will now be a little more at ease."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[356]</span> Mortimer eagerly examined the letter for the postmark, but was
not able to make out from whence it came.
</p>
<p>
"I confess," said he, "I am better satisfied than I was, but am yet at
a loss to judge of the motives which have induced them to pursue so
strange a course."
</p>
<p>
"The motive," cried Tom, "that may be easily explained; and I doubt
not but you will find, although it may at present appear a little
mysterious, Sparkle will be fully able to shew cause and produce effect.
He is however a man of honour and of property, and most likely we may by
this time congratulate you upon the change of your Sister's name. What
a blaze it will make, and she will now most certainly become a sparkling
subject. Hang it, man, don't look so dull upon a bright occasion.
</p>
<pre>
          "To prove pleasure but pain, some have hit on a project,
          We're duller the merrier we grow,
          Exactly the same unaccountable logic
          That talks of cold fire and warm snow.

          For me, born by nature
          For humour and satire,
          I sing and I roar and I quaff;
          Each muscle I twist it,
          I cannot resist it,
          A finger held up makes me laugh.

          For since pleasure's joy's parent, and joy begets mirth,
          Should the subtlest casuist or sophist on earth
          Contradict me, I'd call him an ass and a calf,
          And boldly insist once for all,
          That the only criterion of pleasure's to laugh,
          And sing tol de rol, loi de rol lol."
</pre>
<p>
This mirth of Dash all's did not seem to be in consonance with the
feelings of Mortimer, who hastily took his departure.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said Tom to his Cousin, "having gained some information
respecting one friend, we will now take a stroll through Temple Bar, and
have a peep at Merrywell; he may perhaps want assistance in his present
situation, though I will answer for it he is in a place of perfect
security."
</p>
<p>
"How," said Bob&mdash;"what do you mean?"
</p>
<p>
"Mean, why the traps have nibbled him. He is arrested, and gone to a
lock-up shop, a place of mere accommodation for gentlemen to take up
their abode, for the purpose of <span class="pagenum">[357]</span> arranging their affairs, and
where they can uninterruptedly make up their minds whether to give
bail, put in appearance and defend the suit, or take a trip to Abbott's
Priory; become a three months' student in the college of art, and
undergo the fashionable ceremony of white-washing."
</p>
<p>
"I begin to understand you now," said Bob, "and the only difference
between our two friends is, that one has willingly put on a chain for
life&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"And the other may in all probability (continued Tom,) have to chaff his
time away with a chum&mdash;perhaps not quite so agreeable, though it really
is possible to be very comfortable, if a man can reconcile himself to
the loss of liberty, even in "durance vile."
</p>
<p>
By this time they were walking leisurely along Piccadilly,
</p>
<pre>
          "And marching without any cumbersome load,
          They mark'd every singular sight on the road."
</pre>
<p>
"Who is that meagre looking man and waddling woman, who just passed us?"
inquired Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"An old Bencher," was the reply; "there you see all that is left of a
man of <i>haut ton</i>, one who has moved in the highest circles; but alas!
bad company and bad play have reduced him to what he now is. He has cut
up and turn'd down very well among the usurers and attornies; but it is
impossible to say of him, as of his sirloin of a wife (for she cannot be
called a rib, or at all events a spare rib) that there is any thing like
cut and come again. The poor worn-out Exquisite tack'd himself to his
Lady, to enable him to wipe out a long score, and she determined on
taking him for better for worse, after a little rural felicity in a walk
to have her fortune told by a gipsy at Norwood. He is now crippled in
pocket and person, and wholly dependent upon bounty for the chance of
prolonging a miserable existence. His game is up. But what is life but a
game, at which every one is willing to play? one wins and another loses:
why there have been as many moves among titled persons, Kings, Queens,
Bishops, Lords and Knights, within the last century, as there are in a
game at chess. Pawns have been taken and restored in all classes,
from the Sovereign, who pawns or loses his crown, to the Lady whose
reputation is in pawn, and becomes at last not worth half a crown.
Shuffling, cutting, dealing out and <span class="pagenum">[358]</span> dealing in, double dealing
and double faces, have long been the order of the day. Some men's cards
are all trumps, whilst others have <i>carte blanche</i>; some honours count,
whilst others stand for nothing. For instance, did not the little man
who cast up his final accounts a short time back at St. Helena, like a
Corsican conjurer, shuffle and cut about among kings and queens, knaves
and asses, (aces I mean) dealing out honours when he liked, and taking
trumps as he thought fit?&mdash;did he not deal and take up again almost as
he pleased, having generally an honour in his sleeve to be played at
command, or <i>un roi dans le marche</i>; by which cheating, it was scarcely
possible for any one to get fair play with him, till, flushed by
success, and not knowing how to bear his prosperity, he played too
desperately and too long? The tables were turned upon him, and his
enemies cheated him, first of his liberty, and ultimately of his life."
</p>
<p>
At this moment Tallyho, who was listening in close attention to his
Cousin, struck his foot against a brown paper parcel which rolled before
him.&mdash;"Hallo!" exclaimed he, "what have we here?&mdash;somebody has dropped a
prize."
</p>
<p>
"It is mine, Sir," said an old woman, dropping them a curtsey with a
smile which shone through her features, though thickly begrimed with
snuff.
</p>
<p>
"A bite," said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"I dropp'd it from my pocket, Sir, just now."
</p>
<p>
"And pray," inquired Tom, "what does it contain?" picking it up.
</p>
<p>
"Snuff, Sir," was the reply; "a kind, good-hearted Gentleman gave it to
me&mdash;God bless him, and bless your Honour too!" with an additional smile,
and a still lower curtsey.
</p>
<p>
Upon examining the paper, which had been broken by the kick, Tom
perceived, that by some magic or other, the old woman's snuff had become
sugar.
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!" said he, "they have played some trick upon you, and given you
brimstone instead of snuff, or else you are throwing dust in our eyes."
</p>
<p>
The parcel, which contained a sample of sugar, was carefully rolled up
again and tied, then dropped to be found by any body else who chose to
stoop for it.
</p>
<p>
"This," said Dashall, "does not turn out to be what I first expected;
for the practices of ring and money <span class="pagenum">[359]</span> dropping{1} have, at various
times, been carried on with great success, and to the serious injury
of the unsuspecting. The persons who generally apply themselves to this
species of cheating are no other than gamblers who ingeniously contrive,
by dropping a purse or a ring, to draw in some customer with a view to
induce him to play; and notwithstanding their arts have frequently been
exposed, we every now and then hear of some flat being done by these
sharps, and indeed there are constantly customers in London to be had
one way or another."
</p>
<p>
"Then you had an idea that that parcel was a bait of this kind,"
rejoined Bob.
</p>
<p>
"I did," replied his Cousin; "but it appears to be a legitimate letter
from some industrious mechanic to his friend, and is a curious specimen
of epistolary correspondence; and you perceive there was a person ready
to claim it, which conspired rather to confirm my suspicions, being a
little in the style of the gentry I have alluded to. They vary their
mode of proceeding according to situation and circumstance. Your
money-dropper contrives to find his own property, as if by chance.
He picks up the purse with an exclamation of 'Hallo! what have we
here?&mdash;Zounds! if here is not a prize&mdash;I'm in rare luck to-day&mdash;Ha,
ha, ha, let's have a peep at it&mdash;it feels heavy, and no doubt is worth
having.' While he is examining its contents, up comes his confederate,
who claims a share on account of having been present at the finding.
'Nay, nay,' replies the finder, 'you are not in it. This Gentleman is
the only person that was near me&mdash;was not you, Sir? 'By this means the
novice is induced to assent, or perhaps assert his prior claim. The
finder declares,
</p>
<pre>
     1 The practice of ring-dropping is not wholly confined to
     London, as the following paragraph from the Glasgow Courier,
     a very short time ago, will sufficiently prove:&mdash;'On Monday
     afternoon, when three Highland women, who had been employed
     at a distance from home in the harvest, were returning to
     their habitations, they were accosted by a fellow who had
     walked out a short way with them, 'till he picked up a pair
     of ear-rings and a key for a watch. The fellow politely
     informed the females that they should have half the value of
     the articles, as they were in his company when they were
     found. While they were examining them, another fellow came
     up, who declared at once they were gold, and worth at least
     thirty shillings. After some conversation, the women were
     induced to give fifteen shillings for the articles, and came
     and offered them to a watch-maker for sale, when they
     learned to their mortification that they were not worth
     eighteen pence!'
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[360]</span> that sooner than have any dispute about it, he will divide the
contents in three parts; recommends an adjournment to a public-house in
the neighbourhood, to wet the business and drink over their good luck.
This being consented to, the leading points are accomplished. The
purse of course is found to contain counterfeit money&mdash;Flash-screens or
Fleet-notes,{1} and the division cannot well be made without change can
be procured. Now comes the touch-stone. The Countryman, for such they
generally contrive to inveigle, is perhaps in cash, having sold his hay,
or his cattle, tells them he can give change; which being understood,
the draught-board, cards, or la bagatelle, are introduced, and as the
job is a good one, they can afford to sport some of their newly-acquired
wealth in this way. They drink and play, and fill their grog again. The
Countryman bets; if he loses, he is called upon to pay; if he wins, 'tis
added to what is coming to him out of the purse.
</p>
<p>
"If, after an experiment or two, they find he has but little money, or
fight shy, they bolt, that is, brush off in quick time, leaving him to
answer for the reckoning. But if he is what they term well-breeched,
and full of cash, they stick to him until he is cleaned out,{2} make him
drunk, and, if he turns restive, they mill him. If he should be an
easy cove,{3} he perhaps give them change for their flash notes, or
counterfeit coin, and they leave him as soon as possible, highly pleased
with his fancied success, while they laugh in their sleeves at the dupe
of their artifice."
</p>
<p>
"And is it possible?" inquired Tallyho&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Can such things be,  and overcome us
          Like a summer's cloud?"
</pre>
<p>
"Not without our special wonder," continued Dashall; "but such things
have been practised. Then again, your ring-droppers, or practisers of
the fawney rig, are more cunning in their manoeuvres to turn their wares
into the ready blunt.{4} The pretending to find a ring being one of the
meanest and least profitable exercises of their ingenuity, it forms a
part of their art to find articles of much more

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[361]</span> value, such as rich jewelry, broaches, ear-rings, necklaces set
with diamonds, pearls, &amp;c. sometimes made into a paper parcel, at others
in a small neat red morocco case, in which is stuck a bill of parcels,
giving a high-flown description of the articles, and with an extravagant
price. Proceeding nearly in the same way as the money-droppers with the
dupe, the finder proposes, as he is rather short of <i>steeven</i>,{1} to
<i>swap</i>{2}his share for a comparatively small part of the value stated in
the bill of parcels: and if he succeeds in obtaining one-tenth of that
amount in hard cash, his triumph is complete; for, upon examination, the
diamonds turn out to be nothing but paste&mdash;the pearls, fishes' eyes&mdash;and
the gold is merely polished brass gilt, and altogether of no value.
But this cannot be discovered beforehand, because the <i>bilk</i>{3} is in a
hurry, can't spare time to go to a shop to have the articles valued,
but assures his intended victim, that, as they found together, he should
like to <i>smack the bit</i>,{4 }without <i>blowing the gap</i>,{5} and so help
him G&mdash;d, the thing wants no <i>buttering up</i>,{6} because he is willing to

</pre>
<p>
This conversation was suddenly interrupted by a violent crash just
behind them, as they passed Drury Lane Theatre in their way through
Bussel Court; and Bob, upon turning to ascertain from whence such
portentous sounds proceeded, discovered that he had brought all the
Potentates of the Holy Alliance to his feet. The Alexanders, the
Caesars, the Buonapartes, Shakespeares, Addisons and Popes, lay strewed
upon the pavement, in one undistinguished heap, while a poor Italian lad
with tears in his eyes gazed with indescribable anxiety on the shapeless
ruin&mdash;' Vat shall me do?&mdash;dat man knock him down&mdash;all brokt&mdash;you
pay&mdash;Oh! mine Godt, vat shall do! ' This appeal was made to Dashall and
Tallyho, the latter of whom the poor Italian seemed to fix upon as the
author of his misfortune in upsetting his board of plaster images; and
although he was perfectly unconscious of the accident, the appeal of the
vender of great personages had its desired effect upon them both; and
<span class="pagenum">[362]</span> finding themselves quickly surrounded by spectators, they gave
him some silver, and then pursued their way.
</p>
<p>
"These men," said Dashall, "are generally an industrious and hard-living
people; they walk many miles in the course of a day to find sale for
their images, which they will rather sell at any price than carry back
with them at night; and it is really wonderful how they can make a
living by their traffic."
</p>
<p>
"Ha, ha, ha," said a coarse spoken fellow following&mdash;"how the Jarman
Duck diddled the Dandies just now&mdash;did you twig how he queered the coves
out of seven bob for what was not worth <i>thrums.</i>{1} The <i>Yelper</i>{2}
did his duty well, and finger'd the <i>white wool</i>{3} in good style. I'm
d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d if he was not up to slum, and he whiddied their wattles with
the velvet, and floored the town toddlers easy enough."
</p>
<p>
"How do you mean?" said his companion.
</p>
<p>
"Why you know that foreign blade is an ould tyke about this quarter, and
makes a good deal of money&mdash;many a <i>twelver</i>{4} does he get by buying
up broken images of persons who sell them by wholesale, and he of course
gets them for little or nothing: then what does he do but dresses out
his board, to give them the best appearance he can, and toddles into
the streets, <i>touting</i>{5} for a good customer. The first genteel bit of
flash he meets that he thinks will dub up the possibles,{6} he dashes
down the board, breaks all the broken heads, and appeals in a pitiful
way for remuneration for his loss; so that nine times out of ten he gets
some Johnny-raw or other to stump up the rubbish."
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!" said Dashall, "these fellows are smoking us; and, in the midst
of my instructions to guard you against the abuses of the Metropolis, we
have ourselves become the dupes of an impostor."
</p>
<pre>
     1 Thrums&mdash;A flash term for threepence.

     who makes very pitiful lamentations on the most trifling
     accidents.

     4 Twelver&mdash;A shilling.

     5 Touting&mdash;Is to be upon the sharp look out.

     6 To dub up the possibles&mdash;To stand the nonsense&mdash;are nearly
     synonimous, and mean&mdash;will pay up any demand rather than be
     detained.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[363]</span> "Well," said Tallyho, "it is no more than a practical
illustration of your own observation, that it is scarcely possible for
any person to be at all times secure from the arts and contrivances of
your ingenious friends the Londoners; though I confess I was little in
expectation of finding you, as an old practitioner, so easily let in."
</p>
<p>
"It is not much to be wondered at," continued Tom, "for here we are in
the midst of the very persons whose occupations, if such they may be
termed, ought most to be avoided; for Covent Garden, and Drury Lane,
with their neighbourhoods, are at all times infested with swindlers,
sharpers, whores, thieves, and depredators of all descriptions, for ever
on the look out. It is not long since a man was thrown from a two-pair
of stairs window in Charles Street,{1} which is just by, having been
decoyed into a house of ill fame by a Cyprian, and this in a situation
within sight of the very Police Office itself in Bow Street!"
</p>
<p>
"Huzza! ha, ha, ha, there he goes," vociferated by a variety of voices,
now called their attention, and put an end to their conversation; and
the appearance of a large concourse of people running up Drury Lane,
engrossed their notice as they approached the other end of Russel Court.
</p>
<p>
On coming up with the crowd, they found the cause of the vast assemblage
of persons to be no other than a Quaker{2} decorated with a tri-coloured
cockade, who was
</p>
<pre>
     1 A circumstance of a truly alarming and distressing nature,
     to which Dashall alluded in this place, was recently made
     known to the public in the daily journals, and which should
     serve as a lesson to similar adventurers.

     It appeared that a young man had been induced to enter a
     house of ill fame in Charles Street, Covent Garden, by one
     of its cyprian inmates, to whom he gave some money in order
     for her to provide them with supper; that, upon her return,
     he desired to have the difference between what he had given
     and what she had expended returned to him, which being
     peremptorily refused, he determined to leave the house. On
     descending the stair-case for which purpose, he was met by
     some men, with whom he had a violent struggle to escape;
     they beat and bruised him most unmercifully, and afterwards
     threw him from a two-pair of stairs window into the street,
     where he was found by the Watchman with his skull fractured,
     and in a state of insensibility. We believe all attempts
     have hitherto proved fruitless to bring the actual
     perpetrator or perpetrators of this diabolical deed to
     punishment.

     2 Bow-street.&mdash;Thursday morning an eccentric personage, who
     has for some time been seen about the streets of the
     Metropolis in the habit of a Quaker, and wearing the tri-
     coloured cockade in his broad white hat, made his appearance
     at the door of this office, and presenting a large packet to
     one of the officers, desired him, in a tone of authority, to
     lay it instantly before the Magistrate. The Magistrate (G.
     R. Minshull, Esq.) having perused this singular paper,
     inquired for the person who brought it; and in the next
     moment a young man, in the garb of a Quaker, with a broad-
     brimmed, peaceful-looking, drab-coloured beaver on his
     head, surmounted by a furious tri-coloured cockade, was
     brought before him. This strange anomalous ' personage
     having placed himself very carefully directly in front of
     the bench, smiled complacently upon his Worship, and the
     following laconic colloquy ensued forthwith:&mdash;

     Magistrate&mdash;Did you bring this letter?

     Quaker&mdash;Thou hast said it.

     Magistrate&mdash;-What is your object in bringing it?

     Quaker&mdash;Merely to let thee know what is going on in the
     world&mdash;and, moreover, being informed that if I came to thy
     office, I should be taken into custody, I was desiroiis to
     ascertain whether that information was true.

     Magistrate&mdash;Then I certainly shall not gratify you by
     ordering you into custody.

     Quaker&mdash;Thou wilt do as seemeth right in thy eyes. I assure
     thee I have no inclination to occupy thy time longer than is
     profitable to us, and therefore I will retire whenever thou
     shalt signify that my stay is unpleasant to thee.

     Magistrate&mdash;Why do you wear your hat?&mdash;are you a Quaker?

     Quaker&mdash;Thou sayest it&mdash;but that is not my sole motive for
     wearing it. To be plain with thee, I wear it because I chose
     to do so.    Canst thee tell me of any law which compels me
     to take it off?

     Magistrate&mdash;I'll tell you what, friend, I would seriously
     recommend you to retire from this place as speedily as
     possible.

     Quaker&mdash;I take thy advice&mdash;farewell.

     Thus ended this comical conversation, and the eccentric
     friend immediately departed in peace.

     The brother of the above person attended at the office on
     Saturday, and stated that the Quaker is insane, that he was
     proprietor of an extensive farm near Ryegate, in Surrey, for
     some years; but that in May last his bodily health being
     impaired, he was confined for some time, and on his recovery
     it was found that his intellects were affected, and he was
     put under restraint, but recovered. Some time since he
     absconded from Ryegate, and his friends were unable to
     discover him, until they saw the account of his eccen-
     tricities in the newspapers. Mr. Squire was desirous, if he
     made his appearance again at the office, he should be
     detained. The Magistrate, as a cause for the detention of
     the Quaker, swore the brother to these facts. About three
     o'clock the Quaker walked up Bow-street, when an officer
     conducted him to the presence of the Magistrate, who
     detained him, and at seven o'clock delivered him into the
     care of his brother.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[365]</span> very quietly walking with a Police Officer, and exhibiting a
caricature of himself mounted on a velocipede, and riding over
corruption, &amp;c. It was soon ascertained that he had accepted an
invitation from one of the Magistrates of Bow Street to pay him a visit,
as he had done the day before, and was at that moment going before him.
</p>
<p>
"I apprehend he is a little cracked," said Tom; "but however that may
be, he is a very harmless sort of person. But come, we have other game
in view, and our way lies in a different direction to his."
</p>
<p>
"Clothes, Sir, any clothes to-day?" said an importunate young fellow at
the corner of one of the courts, who at the same time almost obstructed
their passage.
</p>
<p>
Making their way as quickly as they could from this very pressing
personage, who invited them to walk in.
</p>
<p>
"This," said Tom, "is what we generally call a <i>Barker</i>. I believe the
title originated with the Brokers in Moor-fields, where men of this
description parade in the fronts of their employers' houses, incessantly
pressing the passengers to walk in and buy household furniture, as they
do clothes in Rosemary Lane, Seven Dials, Field Lane, Houndsditch, and
several other parts of the town. Ladies' dresses also used to be barked
in Cranbourn Alley and the neighbourhood of Leicester Fields; however,
the nuisance has latterly in some measure abated. The Shop-women in that
part content themselves now-a-days by merely inviting strangers to look
at their goods; but Barkers are still to be found, stationed at the
doors of Mock Auctions, who induce company to assemble, by bawling "Walk
in, the auction is now on," or "Just going to begin." Of these mock
auctions, there have been many opened of an evening, under the imposing
glare of brilliant gas lights, which throws an unusual degree of lustre
upon the articles put up for sale. It is not however very difficult to
distinguish them from the real ones, notwithstanding they assume all the
exterior appearances of genuineness, even up to advertisements in the
newspapers, purporting to be held in the house of a person lately gone
away under embarrassed circumstances, or deceased. They are denominated
Mock Auctions, because no real intention exists on the part of the
sellers to dispose of their articles under a certain price previously
fixed upon, which, although it may not be high, is invariably more than
they are actually worth: besides which, they may be easily discovered by
the anxiety they evince to show the goods to strangers at
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[366]</span>the moment they enter, never failing to bestow over-strained
panegyrics upon every lot they put up, and asking repeatedly&mdash;"What
shall we say for this article? a better cannot be produced;" and
promising, if not approved of when purchased, to change it. The
Auctioneer has a language suited to all companies, and, according to his
view of a customer, can occasionally jest, bully, or perplex him into
a purchase.&mdash;"The goods must be sold at what they will fetch;" and
he declares (notwithstanding among his confederates, who stand by as
bidders, they are run up beyond the real value, in order to catch a
flat,) that "the present bidding can never have paid the manufacturer
for his labour."

In such places, various articles of silver, plate, glass and household
furniture are exposed to sale, but generally made up of damaged
materials, and slight workmanship of little intrinsic value, for the
self-same purpose as the Razor-seller states&mdash;

          "Friend, (cried the Razor-man) I'm no knave;
          As for the razors you have bought,
          Upon my soul!  I never thought
          That they would shave."

          "Not shave!" quoth Hodge, with wond'ring eyes,
          And voice not much unlike an Indian yell;
          "What were they made for then, you dog?"  he cries.
          "Made!  (quoth the fellow with a smile) to sell."

Passing the end of White Horse Yard&mdash;"Here," continued Tom, "in this
yard and the various courts and alleys which lead into it, reside
numerous Girls in the very lowest state of prostitution; and it is
dangerous even in the day time to pass their habitations, at all
events very dangerous to enter any one of them. Do you see the crowd
of squalid, half-clad and half-starved creatures that surround the old
woman at the corner?&mdash;Observe, that young thing without a stocking is
stealing along with a bottle in one hand and a gown in the other; she is

     import, and mean the act of pledging property with a
     Pawnbroker for the loan of money&mdash;most probably derived from
     the practice of having a long spout, which reaches from the
     top of the house of the Pawn-broker (where the goods are
     deposited for safety till redeemed or sold) to the shop,
     where they are first received; through which a small bag is
     dropped upon the ringing of a bell, which conveys the
     tickets or duplicates to a person above stairs, who, upon
     finding them, (unless too bulky) saves himself the trouble
     and loss of time of coming down stairs, by more readily
     conveying them down the spout.

enlivening juice of the juniper to fill the former."
</p>
<pre>
     1 Uncle, sometimes called the Ferrit, or the Flint&mdash;Cant
     terms for Pawnbroker, though many of these gentlemen now
     assume the more reputable appellation of Silversmiths. They
     are willing to lend money upon all sorts of articles of
     household furniture, linen, plate, wearing apparel,
     jewellery, &amp;c. with a certainty of making a very handsome
     profit upon the money so circulated.

     There are in this Metropolis upwards of two hundred and
     thirty Pawnbrokers, and in some cases they are a useful and
     serviceable class of people; and although doubtless many of
     them are honest and reputable persons, there are still among
     them a class of sharpers and swindlers, who obtain licences
     to carry on the business, and bring disgrace upon the
     respectable part of the profession. Every species of fraud
     which can add to the distresses of those who are compelled
     to raise temporary supplies of money is resorted to, and for
     which purpose there are abundance of opportunities. In many
     instances however the utility of these persons, in
     preventing a serious sacrifice of property, cannot be
     denied; for, by advancing to tradesmen and mechanics
     temporary loans upon articles of value at a period of
     necessity, an opportunity of redeeming them is afforded,
     when by their industrious exertions their circumstances are
     improved. Many of them however are receivers of stolen
     good.s, and, under cover of their licence, do much harm to
     the public. Indeed, the very easy mode of raising money by
     means of the Pawnbrokers, operates as an inducement, or at
     least an encouragement, to every species of vice. The
     fraudulent tradesman by their means is enabled to raise
     money on the goods of his creditors, the servant to pledge
     the property of his employer, and the idle or profligate
     mechanic to deposit his working tools, or his work in an
     unfinished state. Many persons in London are in the habit of
     pawning their apparel from Monday morning till Saturday
     night, when they are redeemed, in order to make a decent
     appearance on the next day. In low neighbourhoods, and among
     loose girls, much business is done by Pawnbrokers to good
     advantage; and considerable emolument is derived from women
     of the town. The articles they offer to pledge are generally
     of the most costly nature, and the pilferings of the night
     are usually placed in the hands of an Uncle the next
     morning; and the wary money-lenders, fully acquainted with
     their necessities, just lend what they please; by which
     means they derive a wonderful profit, from the almost
     certainty of these articles never being redeemed.

     The secresy with which a Pawnbroker's business is conducted,
     though very proper for the protection of the honest and
     well-meaning part of the population, to shield them from an
     exposure which might perhaps prove fatal to their business or
     credit, admits of great room for fraud on the part of the
     Money-lender; more particularly as it respects the interest
     allowed upon the pawns. Many persons are willing to pay any
     charge made, rather than expose their necessities by
     appearing before a Magistrate, and acknowledging they have
     been concerned in such transactions.

     Persons who are in the constant habit of pawning are
     generally known by the Pawnbrokers, in most instances
     governed by their will, and compelled to take and pay just
     what they please. Again, much injury arises from the want of
     care in the Pawnbroker to require a proper account, from the
     Pledgers, of the manner in which the goods offered have been
     obtained, as duplicates are commonly given upon fictitious
     names and residences.

     Notwithstanding the care and attention usually paid to the
     examination of the articles received as pledges, these
     gentlemen are sometimes to be duped by their customers. We
     remember an instance of an elderly man, who was in the habit
     of bringing a Dutch clock frequently to a Pawnbroker to
     raise the wind, and for safety, generally left it in a large
     canvass bag, till he became so regular a customer, that his
     clock and bag were often left without inspection; and as it
     was seldom deposited for long together, it was placed in
     some handy nook of the shop in order to lie ready for
     redemption. This system having been carried on for some
     time, no suspicion was entertained of the old man. Upon one
     occasion however the Pawnbroker's olfactory nerves were
     saluted with a smell of a most unsavoury nature, for which
     he could by no means account&mdash;day after day passed, and no
     discovery was made, till at length he determined to overhaul
     every article in his shop, and if possible discover the
     source of a nuisance which appeared rather to increase than
     abate: in doing which, to his utter astonishment, he found
     the old man's Dutch clock trans-formed into a sheep's head,
     enclosed in a small box similar in shape and size to that of
     the clock. It will scarcely be necessary to add, that, being
     in the heat of summer, the sheep's head when turned out was
     in a putrid state, and as green as grass. The Pawn-broker
     declared the old gentleman's works were out of repair, that
     he himself was out of tune, and eventually pledged himself
     never to be so taken in again. After all, however, it must
     be acknowledged that my Uncle is a very accommodating man.

          "My Uncle's the man, I've oft said it before,
          Who is ready and willing to open his door;
          Tho' some on the question may harbour a doubt,
          He's a mill to grind money, which I call a spout.
          Derry down.

          He has three golden balls which hang over his door,
          Which clearly denote that my Uncle's not poor;
          He has money to lend, and he's always so kind,
          He will lend it to such as leave something behind.
          Derry down.

          If to music inclin'd, there's no man can so soon
          Set the hooks of your gamut to excellent tune;
          All his tickets are prizes most carefully book'd,
          And your notes must be good, or you're presently hook'd.
          Derry down.

          Shirts, shoes, and flat-irons, hats, towels, and ruffs,
          To him are the same as rich satins or stuffs;
          From the pillows you lay on, chairs, tables, or sacks,
          He'll take all you have, to the togs on your backs.
          Derry down.

          Then ye who are needy, repair to your friend,
          Who is ready and willing your fortunes to mend;
          He's a purse full of rhino, and that's quite enough,
          Tho' short in his speech, he can shell out short stuff.
          Derry down.

          What a blessing it is, in this place of renown
          To know that we have such an Uncle in town;
          In all cases, degrees, in all places and stations,
          'Tis a good thing to know we've such friendly relations.

"Surely," said Tallyho, "no person could possibly be inveigled by her
charms?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[369]</span> "They are not very blooming just now," answered his Cousin&mdash;"you
do not see her in a right light. It is impossible to contemplate
the cases of these poor creatures without dropping a tear of pity.
Originally seduced from a state of innocence, and eventually abandoned
by their seducers, as well as their well-disposed parents or friends,
they are left at an early age at large upon the world; loathed and

"Many are the gradations from the highest degree of prostitution down
to the trulls that parade the streets by day, and one or two more
steps still include those who keep out all night. Some of the miserable
inhabitants of this quarter are night-birds, who seldom leave their beds
during the day, except to refresh themselves with a drop of Old Tom; but
as the evening approaches, their business commences, when you will see
them decked out like fine ladies, for there are <i>coves of cases</i>,{1} and
others in the vicinity of the Theatres, who live by letting out dresses
for the evening, where they may be accommodated from a camesa{2} to a
richly embroidered full-dress court suit, under the care of spies, who
are upon the look-out that they don't brush off with the stock. Others,
again, are boarded and lodged by the owners of houses of ill-fame, kept
as dirty and as ragged as beggars all day, but who,

It however not unfrequently happens to those unhappy Girls who have not
been successful in their pursuits, and do not bring home with them the
wages of their prostitution, that they are sent to bed without supper,
and sometimes get a good beating into the bargain; besides which, the
Mistress of the house takes care to search them immediately after they
are left by their gallants, by which means they are deprived of every
shilling."

Approaching the City, they espied a crowd of persons assembled together
round the door of Money the perfumer. Upon inquiring, a species of
depreciation was exposed, which had not yet come under their view.

It appeared that a note, purporting to come from a gentleman at the
Tavistock Hotel, desiring Mr. Money to wait on him to take measure of
his cranium for a fashionable peruke, had drawn him from home, and that
during his absence, a lad, in breathless haste, as if dispatched by the

that his property was diminished in his absence by the successful
artifices of a designing villain. This tale having got wind in the
neighbourhood, persons were flocking round him to advise as to the mode
of pursuit, and many were entertaining each other by relations of a
similar nature; but our heroes having their friend Merrywell in view (or
rather his interest) made the best of their way to the Lock-up-house.

          "The world its trite opinion holds of those

          And thus methinks some sage, whose wisdom frames

<p>
ON entering the Lock-up House, Bob felt a few uneasy sensations at
hearing the key turned. The leary Bum-trap ushered the Gemmen up stairs,
while Tallyho was endeavouring to compose his agitated spirits, and
reconcile himself to the prospect before him, which, at the moment, was
not of the most cheering nature.
</p>
<p>
"What, my gay fellow," said Merry well, "glad to see you&mdash;was just going
to scribble a line to inform you of my disaster. Zounds! you look as
melancholy as the first line of an humble petition, or the author of a
new piece the day after its damnation."
</p>
<p>
"In truth," replied Bob, "this is no place to inspire a man with high
spirits."
</p>
<p>
"That's as it may be," rejoined Merry well; "a man with money in his
pocket may see as much Real Life in London within these walls as those
who ramble at large through the mazes of what is termed liberty."
</p>
<p>
"But," continued Tom, "it must be admitted that the views are more
limited."
</p>
<p>
"By no means," was the reply. "Here a man is at perfect liberty to
contemplate and cogitate without fear of being agitated. Here he may
trace over past recollections, and enjoy future anticipations free from
the noise and bustle of crowded streets, or the fatigue of attending
fashionable routs, balls, and assemblies. Besides which, it forms so
important a part of Life in London, that few without a residence in
a place of this kind can imagine its utility. It invigorates genius,
concentrates ingenuity, and stimulates invention."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[373]</span> "Hey dey!" said Tallyho, looking out of the window, and
perceiving a dashing tandem draw up to the door&mdash;"who have we here? some
high company, no doubt."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, you are right; that man in the great coat, who manages his cattle
with such dexterity, is no other than the king of the castle. He is
the major domo, or, in other words, the Bailiff himself. That short,
stout-looking man in boots and buckskins, is his assistant, vulgarly
called his Bum.{1} The other is a Gentleman desirous of lodging in
a genteel neighbourhood, and is recommended by them to take up his
residence here."
</p>
<p>
"What," inquired Bob, "do Bailiffs drive gigs and tandems?"
</p>
<p>
"To be sure they do," was the reply; "formerly they were low-bred
fellows, who would undertake any dirty business for a maintenance, as
you will see them represented in the old prints and caricatures, muffled
up in Îreat coats, and carrying bludgeons; but, in present Real life,
you will find them quite the reverse, unless they find it necessary
to assume a disguise in order to nibble a queer cove who proves shy of
their company'; but among Gentlemen, none are so stylish, and at the
same time so accommodating&mdash;you are served with the process in a
private and elegant way, and if not convenient to come to an immediate
arrangement, a gig is ready in the highest taste, to convey you from
your habitation to your place of retirement, and you may pass through
the most crowded streets of the city, and recognise your friends,
without fear of suspicion. Upon some occasions, they will also carry
their politeness so far as to inform an individual he will be wanted
on such a day, and must come&mdash;a circumstance which has the effect of
preventing any person from knowing the period of departure, or the place
of destination; consequently, the arrested party is gone out of town for
a few days, and the matter all blows over without any injury sustained.
This is the third time since I have been in the house that the tandem
has started from the door, and returned with a new importation."
</p>
<p>
By this time, the gig having been discharged of its cargo, was
reascended by the Master and his man, and bowl'd off again in gay style
for the further accommodation of fashionable friends, whose society was
in such high
</p>
<pre>
     1 See Bum-trap), page 166.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[374]</span> estimation, that no excuse or denial could avail, and who being
so urgently wanted, must come.
</p>
<p>
"'Tis a happy age we live in," said Merry well; "the improvements are
evident enough; every thing is done with so much facility and gentility,
that even the race of bailiffs are transformed from frightful and
ferocious-looking persons to the most dashing, polite and accommodating
characters in the world. He however, like others, must have his
assistant, and occasional substitute.
</p>
<p>
"A man in this happy era is really of no use whatever to himself. It
is a principle on which every body, that is any body, acts, that no one
should do any thing for himself, if he can procure another to do it for
him. Accordingly, there is hardly the most simple performance in nature
for the more easy execution of which an operator or machine of some
kind' or other is not employed or invented; and a man who has had the
misfortune to lose, or chuses not to use any of his limbs or senses,
may meet with people ready to perform all their functions for him, from
paring his nails and cutting his corns, to forming an opinion. No man
cleans his own teeth who can afford to pay a dentist; and hundreds get
their livelihood by shaving the chins and combing the hair of their
neighbours, though many, it must be admitted, comb their neighbour's
locks for nothing. The powers of man and the elements of nature even are
set aside, the use of limbs and air being both superseded by steam; in
short, every thing is done by proxy&mdash;death not excepted, for we are told
that our soldiers and sailors die for us. Marriage in certain ranks is
on this footing. A prince marries by proxy, and sometimes lives for
ever after as if he thought all the obligations of wedlock were to be
performed in a similar manner. A nobleman, it is true, will here take
the trouble to officiate in the first instance in person; but there are
plenty of cases to shew that nothing is further from his noble mind than
the idea of continuing his slavery, while others can be found to take
the labour off his hands. So numerous are the royal roads to every
desideratum, and so averse is every true gentleman from doing any thing
for himself, that it is to be dreaded lest it should grow impolite to
chew one's own victuals; and we are aware that there are great numbers
who, not getting their share of Heaven's provision, may be said to
submit to have their food eat for them."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[375]</span> Tallyho laugh'd, and Dashall signified his assent to the
whimsical observations of Merrywell, by a shrug of the shoulders and an
approving smile.
</p>
<p>
"Apropos," said Merrywell&mdash;"what is the news of our friend Sparkle?"
</p>
<p>
"O, (replied Tom) he is for trying a chance in the Lottery of Life, and
has perhaps by this time gained the prize of Matrimony:{1} but what part
of the globe he inhabits it is impossible for me to say&mdash;however, he is
with Miss Mortimer probably on the road to Gretna."
</p>
<p>
"Success to his enterprise," continued Merrywell; "and if they are
destined to travel through life together, may they have thumping luck
and pretty children. Marriage to some is a bitter cup of continued
misery&mdash;may the reverse be his lot."
</p>
<p>
"Amen," responded Dashall.
</p>
<p>
"By the way," said Merrywell, "I hope you will favour me with your
company for the afternoon, and I doubt not we shall start some game
within these walls well worthy of pursuit; and as I intend to remove to
more commodious apartments within a day or two, I shall certainly expect
to have a visit from you during my abode in the county of Surrey."
</p>
<p>
"Going to College?" inquired Tom.
</p>
<p>
"Yes; I am off upon a sporting excursion for a month or two, and I
have an idea of making it yield both pleasure and profit. An occasional
residence in Abbot's Park is one of the necessary measures for the
completion of a Real Life in London education. It is a fashionable
retreat absolutely necessary, and therefore I have voluntarily
determined upon it. What rare advice a young man may pick up in the

skirmishing."
</p>
<p>
"And pray," says Tallyho, "what do you term skirmishing?"
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you," was the reply. "When you have got as deeply in debt
every where as you can, you may still remain on the town as a Sunday-man
for a brace of years, and with good management perhaps longer. Next
you may toddle off to Scotland for another twelvemonth, and live in the
sanctuary of Holyrood House, after seeing the North, where writs will
not arrive in time to touch you. When tired of this, and in debt even in
the sanctuary, and when you have worn out all your friends by borrowing
of them to support you in style there, you can brush off on a Sunday to
the Isle of Man, where you are sure to meet a parcel of blades who will
be glad of your company if you are but a pleasant fellow. Here you may
live awhile upon them, and get in debt (if you can, for the Manx-men
have very little faith,) in the Island. From this, you must lastly
effect your escape in an open boat, and make your appearance in London
as a new face. Here you will find some flats of your acquaintance very
glad to see you, even if you are indebted to them, from the pleasures
of recollection accruing from past scenes of jollity and merriment.
You must be sure to amuse them with a good tale of a law-suit, or the
declining health of a rich old Uncle, from either of which you are
certain of deriving a second fortune. Now manage to get arrested, and
you will find some, who believe your story, ready to bail you. You can
then put off these actions for two years more, and afterwards make a
virtue of surrendering yourself in order to relieve your friends, who of
course will begin to be alarmed, and feel so grateful for this supposed
mark of propriety, that they will support you for a while in prison,
until you get white-washed. In all this experience, and with such a long
list of acquaintances, it will be hard if some will not give you a lift
at getting over your difficulties. Then you start again as a nominal
Land-surveyor, Money-scrivener, Horse-dealer, or as a Sleeping-partner
in some mercantile concern&mdash;such, for instance, as coals, wine, &amp;c. Your
popularity and extensive acquaintance will get your Partner a number
of customers, and then if you don't succeed, you have only to become a
Bankrupt, secure your certificate, and start free again in some other
line. Then <span class="pagenum">[377]</span> there are other good chances, for a man may marry once
or twice. Old or sickly women are best suited for the purpose, and their
fortunes will help you for a year or two at least, if only a thousand or
two pounds. Lastly, make up a purse» laugh at the flats, and finish on
the Continent."
</p>
<p>
"Very animated description indeed," cried Dashall, "and salutary advice,
truly."
</p>
<p>
"Too good to be lost," continued Merrywell.
</p>
<p>
"And yet rather too frequently acted on, it is to be feared."
</p>
<p>
"Probably so&mdash;"

"But mark me, this is fancy's sketch," and may perhaps appear a little
too highly coloured; but if you remain with me, we will clip deeper into
the reality of the subject by a little information from the official
personage himself, who holds dominion over these premises; and we may
perhaps also find some agreeable and intelligent company in his house."
</p>
<p>
This proposition being agreed to, and directions given accordingly by
Merrywell to prepare dinner, our party gave loose to opinions of life,
observations on men and mariners, exactly as they presented themselves
to the imagination of each speaker, and Merrywell evidently proved
himself a close observer of character.
</p>
<p>
"Places like this," said he, "are generally inhabited by the profligate
of fashion, the ingenious artist, or the plodding mechanic. The first
is one who cares not who suffers, so he obtains a discharge from his
incumberances: having figured away for some time in the labyrinths of
folly and extravagance, till finding the needful run taper, he yields
to John Doe and Richard Roe as a matter of course, passes through his
degrees in the study of the laws by retiring to the Fleet or King's
Bench, and returns to the world with a clean face, and an increased
stock of information to continue his career. The second are men who
have heads to contrive and hands to execute improvements in scientific
pursuits, probably exhausting their time, their health, and their
property, in the completion of their projects, but who are impeded in
their progress, and compelled to finish their intentions in durance
vile, by the rapacity of their creditors. And the last are persons
subjected to all the casualties of trade and the arts of the former, and
unable to meet the peremptory demands of <span class="pagenum">[378]</span> those they are indebted
to; but they seldom inhabit these places long, unless they can pay
well for their accommodations. Money is therefore as useful in a
lock-up-house or a prison as in any other situation of life.
</p>
<p>
"Money, with the generality of people, is every thing; it is the
universal Talisman; there is magic in its very name. It ameliorates all
the miserable circumstances of life, and the sound of it may almost be
termed life itself. It is the balm, the comfort, and the restorative.
It must indeed be truly mortifying to the opulent, to observe that the
attachment of their dependents, and even the apparent esteem of their
friends, arises from the respect paid to riches. The vulgar herd bow
with reverence and respect before the wealthy; but it is in fact
the money, and not the individual, which they worship. Doubtless, a
philosophic Tallow-chandler would hasten from the contemplation of the
starry heavens to vend a farthing rushlight; and it therefore cannot
be wondered at that the Sheriffs-officer, who serves you with a writ
because you have not money enough to discharge the just demands against
you, should determine at least to get as much as he can out of you, and,
when he finds your resources exhausted, that he should remove you to the
common receptacle of debtors; which however cannot be done to your own
satisfaction without some money; for if you wish a particular place of
residence, or the most trifling accommodation, there are fees to pay,
even on entering a prison."
</p>
<p>
"In that case then," said Tallyho, "a man is actually obliged to pay for
going to a prison."
</p>
<p>
"Precisely so, unless he is willing to mingle with the very lowest order
of society. But come, we will walk into the Coffee-room, and take a view
of the inmates."
</p>
<p>
Upon entering this, which was a small dark room, they heard a great
number of voices, and in one corner found several of the prisoners
surrounding a Bagatelle-board, and playing for porter, ale, &amp;c; in
another corner was a young man in close conversation with an
Attorney; and a little further distant, was a hard-featured man taking
instructions from the Turnkey how to act. Here was a poor Player, who
declared he would take the benefit of the Act, and afterwards take a
benefit at the Theatre to reestablish himself. There a Poet racking
his imagination, and roving amidst the flowers of fancy, giving a few
touches by way of finish to an Ode to Liberty, with the <span class="pagenum">[379]</span> produce
of which he indulged himself in a hope of obtaining the subject of his
Muse. The conversation was of a mingled nature. The vociferations of the
Bagatelle-players&mdash;the whispers of the Attorney and his Client&mdash;and the
declarations of the prisoner to the Turnkey, "That he would be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
if he did not sarve 'em out, and floor the whole boiling of them,"
were now and then interrupted by the notes of a violin playing the most
lively airs in an animated and tasteful style. The Performer however was
not visible, but appeared to be so near, that Merrywell, who was a great
lover of music, beckoned his friends to follow him. They now entered a
small yard at the back of the house, the usual promenade of those who
resided in it, and found the Musician seated on one of the benches,
which were continued nearly round the yard, and which of itself formed
a panorama of rural scenery. Here was the bubbling cascade and the lofty
fountain&mdash;there the shady grove of majestic poplars, and the meandering
stream glittering in the resplendent lustre of a rising sun. The waving
foliage however and the bubbling fountain were not to be seen or heard,
(as these beauties were only to be contemplated in the labours of the
painter;) but to make up for the absence of these with the harmony
of the birds and the ripplings of the stream, the Musician was
endeavouring, like an Arcadian shepherd with his pipe, to make the
woods resound with the notes of his fiddle, surrounded by some of his
fellow-prisoners, who did not fail to applaud his skill and reward his
kindness, by supplying him with rosin, as they termed it, which was by
handing him the heavy-wet as often as they found his elbow at rest. In
one place was to be seen a Butcher, who upon his capture was visited by
his wife with a child in her arms, upon whom the melody seemed to have
no effect. She was an interesting and delicate-looking woman, whose
agitation of spirits upon so melancholy an occasion were evidenced by
streaming tears from a pair of lovely dark eyes; and the Butcher, as
evidently forgetful of his usual calling, was sympathising with, and
endeavouring to soothe her into composure, and fondling the child. In
another, a person who had the appearance of an Half-pay Officer, with
Hessian boots, blue pantaloons, and a black silk handkerchief, sat with
his arms folded almost without taking notice of what was passing around
him, though a rough Sailor with a pipe in his mouth occasionally <span class="pagenum">[380]</span>
enlivened the scene by accompanying the notes of the Musician with a
characteristic dance, which he termed a Horn-spike.
</p>
<p>
It was a fine scene of Real Life, and after taking a few turns in the
gardens of the Lock-up or Sponging-house, they returned to Merrywell's
apartments, which they had scarcely entered, when the tandem drew up to
the door.
</p>
<p>
"More company," said Merry well.
</p>
<p>
"And perhaps the more the merrier," replied Tom.
</p>
<p>
"That is as it may prove," was the reply; "for the company of this
house ace as various at times as can be met with in any other situation.
However, this appears to wear the form of one of our fashionable,
high-life Gentlemen; but appearances are often deceitful, we shall
perhaps hear more of him presently&mdash;he may turn out to be one of the
prodigals who calculate the duration of life at about ten years, that
is, to have a short life and a merry one."
</p>
<p>
"That seems to me to be rather a short career, too," exclaimed Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, nay, that is a long calculation, for it frequently cannot be made
to last half the number. In the first place, the Pupil learns every kind
of extravagance, which he practises en maitre the two next years. These
make an end of his fortune. He lives two more on credit, established
while his property lasted. The next two years he has a letter of
licence, and contrives to live by ways and means (for he has grown
comparatively knowing.) Then he marries, and the wife has the honour
of discharging his debts, her fortune proving just sufficient for the
purpose. Then he manages to live a couple of years more on credit, and
retires to one of his Majesty's prisons."
</p>
<p>
By this time Mr. Safebind made his appearance, and with great politeness
inquired if the Gentlemen were accommodated in the way they wished?
Upon being assured of this, and requested to take a seat, after some
introductory conversation, he gave them the following account of himself
and his business:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"We have brought nine Gemmen into the house this morning; and, though I
say it, no Gemman goes out that would have any objection to come into it
again."
</p>
<p>
Tallyho shrugg'd up his shoulders in a way that seemed to imply a doubt.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[381]</span> "For," continued he, "a Gemman that is a Gemman shall always find
genteel treatment here. I always acts upon honour and secrecy; and if as
how a Gemman can't bring his affairs into a comfortable shape here, why
then he is convey'd away without exposure, that is, if he understands
things."
</p>
<p>
With assurances of this kind, the veracity of which no one present could
doubt, they were entertained for some time by their loquacious Host,
who, having the gift of the gab,{1} would probably have continued long
in the same strain of important information; when dinner was placed on
the table, and they fell to with good appetites, seeming almost to have
made use of the customary grace among theatricals.{2}
</p>
<p>
"The table cleared, the frequent glass goes round, And joke and song and
merriment abound."
</p>
<p>
"Your house," said Dashall, "might well be termed the Temple of the
Arts, since their real votaries are so frequently its inhabitants."
</p>
<p>
"Very true, Sir," said Safebind, "and as the Poet observes, it is as
often graced by the presence of the devotees to the Sciences: in point
of company he says we may almost call it multum in parvo, or the Camera
Obscura of Life. There are at this time within these walls, a learned
Alchymist, two Students in Anatomy, and a Physician&mdash;a Poet, a Player,
and a Musician. The Player is an adept at mimicry, the Musician a good
player, and the Poet no bad stick at a rhyme; all anxious to turn their
talents to good account, and, when mingled together, productive
of harmony, though the situation they are in at present is rather
discordant to their feelings; but then you know 'tis said, that discord
is the soul of harmony, and they knocked up a duet among themselves
yesterday, which I thought highly amusing."
</p>
<p>
"I am fond of music," said Merry well&mdash;"do you think they would take a
glass of wine with us?"
</p>
<pre>
     1 Gift of the gab&mdash;Fluency of speech.

     2 It is a very common thing among the minor theatricals,
     when detained at rehearsals, &amp;c. to adjourn to some
     convenient room in the neighbourhood for refreshment, and
     equally common for them to commence operations in a truly
     dramatic way, by ex-claiming to each other in the language
     of Shakespeare,

          "Come on, Macbeth&mdash;come on, Macduff,
          And d&mdash;&mdash;-d be he who first cries&mdash;hold, enough."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[382]</span> "Most readily, no doubt," was the reply. "I will introduce them
in a minute." Thus saying, he left the room, and in a very few minutes
returned with the three votaries of Apollo, who soon joined in the
conversation upon general subjects. The Player now discovered his
loquacity; the Poet his sagacity; and the Musician his pertinacity,
for he thought no tones so good as those produced by himself, nor no
notes&mdash;we beg pardon, none but bank notes&mdash;equal to his own.
</p>
<p>
It will be sufficient for our present purpose to add, that the
bottle circulated 'quickly, and what with the songs of the Poet, the
recitations of the Player, and the notes of the Fiddler, time, which
perfects all intellectual ability, and also destroys the most stupendous
monuments of art, brought the sons of Apollo under the table, and
admonished Dashall and his Cousin to depart; which they accordingly
did, after a promise to see their friend Merry well in his intended new
quarters.<span class="pagenum">[383]</span>

<h2>
    CHAPTER XXIV
</h2>
<pre>
          "All nations boast some men of nobler mind,
          Their scholars, heroes, benefactors kind:
          And Britain has her share among the rest,
          Of men the wisest, boldest and the best:
          Yet we of knaves and fools have ample share,
          And eccentricities beyond compare.
          Full many a life is spent, and many a purse,
          In mighty nothings, or in something worse."
</pre>
<p>
THE next scene which Tom was anxious to introduce to his Cousin's
notice was that of a Political Dinner; but while they were preparing for
departure, a letter arrived which completely satisfied the mind of the
Hon. Tom Dashall as to the motives and views of their friend Sparkle,
and ran as follows:
</p>
<p>
"Dear Dashall,
</p>
<p>
"Having rivetted the chains of matrimony on the religious anvil of
Gretna Green, I am now one of the happiest fellows in existence.
My election is crowned with success, and I venture to presume all
after-petitions will be rejected as frivolous and vexatious. The once
lovely Miss Mortimer is now the ever to be loved Mrs. Sparkle. I shall
not now detain your attention by an account of our proceedings or
adventures on the road: we shall have many more convenient opportunities
of indulging in such details when we meet, replete as I can assure you
they are with interest.
</p>
<p>
"I have written instructions to my agent in town for the immediate
disposal of my paternal estate in Wiltshire, and mean hereafter to take
up my abode on one I have recently purchased in the neighbourhood of
Belville Hall, where I anticipate many pleasurable opportunities
of seeing you and our friend Tallyho surrounding my hospitable and
(hereafter) family board. We shall be there within a month, as we mean
to reach our place of destination by easy stages, and look about us.
</p>
<p>
"Please remember me to all old friends in Town, and believe as ever,
</p>
<p>
Your's truly,
</p>
<p>
"Charles Sparkle."
</p>
<p>
"Carlisle."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[384 ]</span> The receipt of this letter and its contents were immediately
communicated to young Mortimer, who had already received some
intelligence of a similar nature, which had the effect of allaying
apprehension and dismissing fear for his Sister's safety. The mysterious
circumstances were at once explained, and harmony was restored to the
previously agitated family.
</p>
<p>
"I am truly glad of this information," said Tom, "and as we are at
present likely to be politically engaged, we cannot do less than take a
bumper or two after dinner, to the health and happiness of the Candidate
who so emphatically observes, he has gained his election, and, in the
true language of every Patriot, declares he is the happiest man alive,
notwithstanding the rivets by which he is bound."
</p>
<p>
"You are inclined to be severe," said Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"By no means," replied Dashall; "the language of the letter certainly
seems a little in consonance with my observation, but I am sincere in my
good wishes towards the writer and his amiable wife. Come, we must now
take a view of other scenes, hear long speeches, drink repeated bumpers,
and shout with lungs of leather till the air resounds with peals of
approbation.
</p>
<p>
"We shall there see and hear the great men of the nation, Or at least
who are such in their own estimation."
</p>
<pre>
          "Great in the name a patriot father bore,
          Behold a youth of promise boldly soar,
          Outstrip his fellows, clamb'ring height extreme,
          And reach to eminence almost supreme.
          With well-worn mask, and virtue's fair pretence,
          And all the art of smooth-tongued eloquence,
          He talks of wise reform, of rights most dear,
          Till half the nation thinks the man sincere."
</pre>
<p>
"Hey day," said Tallyho, "who do you apply this to?"
</p>
<p>
"Those who find the cap fit may wear it," was the reply&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
I leave it wholly to the discriminating few who can discover what
belongs to themselves, without further comment."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[385]</span> By this time they had arrived at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in
the Strand, where they found a great number of persons assembled, Sir
F. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; having been announced as President. In a few minutes he was
ushered into the room with all due pomp and ceremony, preceded by
the Stewards for the occasion, and accompanied by a numerous body of
friends, consisting of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Major C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and others, though
not equally prominent, equally zealous. During dinner time all went on
smoothly, except in some instances, where the voracity of some of
the visitors almost occasioned a chopping off the fingers of their
neighbours; but the cloth once removed, and 'Non nobis Domine' sung by
professional Gentlemen, had the effect of calling the attention of the
company to harmony. The Band in the orchestra played, 'O give me Death
or Liberty'&mdash;'Erin go brach'&mdash;'Britons strike home'&mdash;and 'Whilst happy
in my native Land.' The Singers introduced 'Scots wha hae wi' Wallace
bled'&mdash;'Peruvians wake to Glory'&mdash;and the 'Tyrolese Hymn.' But the
spirit of oratory, enlivened by the fire of the bottle, exhibited its
illuminating sparks in a blaze of lustre which eclipsed even the gas
lights by which they were surrounded; so much so, that the Waiters
themselves became confused, and remained stationary, or, when they
moved, were so dazzled by the patriotic effusions of the various
Speakers, that they fell over each other, spilt the wine in the pockets
of the company, and, by making afterwards a hasty retreat, left them to
fight or argue between each other for supposed liberties taken even by
their immediate friends.
</p>
<a name="image-0003"><!--IMG--></a>

alt="Page385 Political Dinner 
">
</center>

<p>
Unbridled feelings of patriotic ardour appeared to pervade every one
present; and what with the splendid oratory of the speakers, and the
deafening vociferations of the hearers, at the conclusion of what
was generally considered a good point, a sufficient indication of the
feelings by which they were all animated was evinced.
</p>
<p>
At the lower end of the table sat a facetious clerical Gentleman, who,
unmindful of his ministerial duties, was loud in his condemnation of
ministers, and as loud in his approbation of those who gave them what
he repeatedly called a good hit. But here a subject of great laughter
occurred; for Mr. Marrowfat, the Pea-merchant of Covent-Garden, and Mr.
Barrowbed, the Feathermonger of Drury Lane, in their zeal for the good
cause, arising at the same moment, big with ardour and sentiment, to
address the <span class="pagenum">[386]</span> Chair on a subject of the most momentous importance
in their consideration, and desirous to signalize themselves
individually, so completely defeated their objects by over anxiety to
gain precedence, that they rolled over each other on the floor, to the
inexpressible amusement of the company, and the total obliteration of
their intended observations; so much so, that the harangue meant to
enlighten their friends, ended in a fine colloquy of abuse upon each
other.
</p>
<p>
The bottles, the glasses, and the other paraphernalia of the table
suffered considerable diminution in the descent of these modern Ciceros,
and a variety of speakers arising upon their downfall, created so much
confusion, that our Heroes, fearing it would be some time before harmony
could be restored, took up their hats and walked.
</p>
<p>
"Now," said Dashall, as they left the house, "you have had a full
view of the pleasantries of a Political Dinner; and having seen the
characters by which such an entertainment is generally attended, any
further account of them is almost rendered useless."
</p>
<p>
"At least," replied Tallyho, "I have been gratified by the view of some
of the leading men who contribute to fill up the columns of your London
Newspapers."
</p>
<p>
"Egad!" said his Cousin, "now I think of it, there is a tine opportunity
of amusing ourselves for the remainder of the evening by a peep at
another certain house in Westminster: whether it may be assimilated, in
point of character or contents, to what we have just witnessed, I shall
leave you, after taking a review, to determine."
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean?" inquired Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
"Charley's, my boy, that's the place for sport, something in the old
style. The Professors there are all of the ancient school, and we shall
just be in time for the first Lecture. It is a school of science, and
though established upon the ancient construction, is highly suitable to
the taste of the moderns."
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!" replied Bob, "our heads are hardly in cue for philosophy after
so much wine and noise; we had better defer it to another opportunity."
</p>
<p>
"Nay, nay, now's the very time for it&mdash;it will revive the recollection
of some of your former sports;
</p>
<pre>
          For, midst our luxuries be it understood,
          Some traits remain of rugged hardihood."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[387]</span> Charley is a good caterer for the public appetite, and, to
diversify the amusements of a Life in London, we will have a little
chaff among the Bear-baiters."
</p>
<p>
Tally-ho stared for a moment; then burst into laughter at the curious
introduction his Cousin had given to this subject. "I have long
perceived your talent for embellishment, but certainly was not prepared
for the conclusion; but you ought rather to have denominated them
Students in Natural History."
</p>
<p>
"And what is that but a branch of Philosophy?" inquired Dashall.
"However, we are discussing points of opinion rather than hastening to
the scene of action to become judges of facts&mdash;Allons."
</p>
<p>
Upon saying this, they moved forward with increased celerity towards
Tothill-fields, and soon reached their proposed place of destination.
</p>
<p>
On entering, Tallyho was reminded by his Cousin to button up his
toggery, keep his ogles in action, and be awake. "For," said he, "you
will here have to mingle with some of the queer Gills and rum Covies of
all ranks."
</p>
<p>
This advice being taken, they soon found themselves in this temple of
torment, where Bob surveyed a motly group assembled, and at that moment
engaged in the sports of the evening. The generality of the company bore
the appearance of Butchers, Dog-fanciers and Ruffians, intermingled
here and there with a few Sprigs of Fashion, a few Corinthian Sicells,
Coster-mongers, Coal-heavers, Watermen, Soldiers, and Livery-servants.

">
</center>

<p>
The bear was just then pinn'd by a dog belonging to a real lover of the
game, who, with his shirt-sleeves tuck'd up, declared he was a d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
good one, and nothing but a good one, so help him G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d. This dog, at
the hazard of his life, had seized poor Bruin by the under lip, who
sent forth a tremendous howl indicative of his sufferings, and was
endeavouring to give him a fraternal hug; many other dogs were barking
aloud with anxiety to take an active share in the amusement, while the
bear, who was chained by the neck to a staple in the wall, and compelled
to keep an almost erect posture, shook his antagonist with all the fury
of madness produced by excessive torture. In the mean time bets were
made and watches pull'd forth, to decide how long the bow-wow would
bother the ragged Russian. The Dog-breeders were chaffing each other
upon the value of their canine property, each holding his <span class="pagenum">[388]</span>
brother-puppy between his legs, till a fair opportunity for a let-loose
offered, and many wagers were won and lost in a short space of time. Bob
remained a silent spectator; while his Cousin, who was better up to the
gossip, mixt with the hard-featured sportsmen, inquired the names of
their dogs, what prices were fix'd upon, when they had fought last, and
other questions equally important to amateurs.
</p>
<p>
Bruin got rid of his customers in succession as they came up to him,
and when they had once made a seizure, it was generally by a hug which
almost deprived them of life, at least it took from them the power of
continuing their hold; but his release from one was only the signal for
attack from another.
</p>
<p>
While this exhibition continued, Tom could not help calling his Cousin's
attention to an almost bald-headed man, who occupied a front seat, and
sat with his dog, which was something of the bull breed, between his
legs, while the paws of the animal rested on the top rail, and which
forcibly brought to his recollection the well-known anecdote of Garrick
and the Butcher's dog with his master's wig on, while the greasy
carcass-dealer was wiping the perspiration from his uncovered
pericranium.
</p>
<p>
Bob, who had seen a badger-bait, and occasionally at fairs in the
country a dancing bear, had never before seen a bear-bait, stood up most
of the time, observing those around him, and paying attention to their
proceedings while entertaining sentiments somewhat similar to the
following lines:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "What boisterous shouts, what blasphemies obscene,
          What eager movements urge each threatening mien!
          Present the spectacle of human kind,
          Devoid of feeling&mdash;destitute of mind;
          With ev'ry dreadful passion rous'd to flame,
          All sense of justice lost and sense of shame."
</pre>
<p>
When Charley the proprietor thought his bear was sufficiently exercised
for the night, he was led to his den, lacerated and almost lamed, to
recover of his wounds, with an intention that he should "fight his
battles o'er again." Meanwhile Tom and Bob walk'd homeward.
</p>
<p>
The next day having been appointed for the coronation of our most
gracious Sovereign, our friends were off at an early hour in the
morning, to secure their seats in <span class="pagenum">[389]</span> Westminster Hall; and on their
way they met the carriage of our disappointed and now much lamented
Queen, her endeavours to obtain admission to the Abbey having proved
fruitless.
</p>
<pre>
          "Oh that the Monarch had as firmly stood
          In all his acts to serve the public good,
          As in that moment of heartfelt joy
          That firmness acted only to destroy
          A nation's hope&mdash;to every heart allied,
          Who lived in sorrow, and lamented died!"
</pre>
<p>
It was a painful circumstance to Dashall, who was seldom severe in his
judgments, or harsh in his censures. He regretted its occurrence, and it
operated in some degree to rob a splendid ceremony of its magnificence,
and to sever from royalty half its dignity.
</p>
<p>
The preparations however were arranged upon a scale of grandeur suited
to the occasion. The exterior of Westminster Hall and Abbey presented
a most interesting appearance. Commodious seats were erected for the
accommodation of spectators to view the procession in its moving order,
and were thronged with thousands of anxious subjects to greet their
Sovereign with demonstrations of loyalty and love.
</p>
<p>
It was certainly a proud day of national festivity. The firing of guns
and the ringing of bells announced the progress of the Coronation in
its various stages to completion; and in the evening Hyde Park was
brilliantly and tastefully illuminated, and an extensive range of
excellent fireworks were discharged under the direction of Sir William
Congreve. We must however confine ourselves to that which came under the
view of the Hon. Tom Dashall and his Cousin, who, being seated in
the Hall, had a fine opportunity of witnessing the banquet, and the
challenge of the Champion.
</p>
<p>
A flooring of wood had been laid down in the Hall at an elevation of
fourteen inches above the flags. Three tiers of galleries were erected
on each side, covered with a rich and profuse scarlet drapery falling
from a cornice formed of a double row of gold-twisted rope, and
ornamented with a succession of magnificent gold pelmets and rosettes.
The front of the door which entered from the passage without, was
covered with a curtain of scarlet, trimmed with deep gold fringe, and
looped up on each side with <span class="pagenum">[390]</span> silken ropes. The floor, and to the
extremity of the first three steps of the Throne, was covered with a
splendid Persian-pattern Wilton carpet, and the remainder of the steps
with scarlet baize.
</p>
<p>
The canopy of the throne, which was square, was surrounded by a
beautiful carved and gilt cornice, prepared by Mr. Evans. Beneath the
cornice hung a succession of crimson-velvet pelmet drapery, each pelmet
having embroidered upon it a rose, a thistle, a crown, or a harp.
Surmounting the cornice in front was a gilt crown upon a velvet cushion,
over the letters "Geo. IV." supported on each side by an antique gilt
ornament. The entire back of the throne, as well as the interior of the
canopy, were covered with crimson Genoa velvet, which was relieved by a
treble row of broad and narrow gold lace which surrounded the whole.
In the centre of the back were the royal arms, the lion and the unicorn
rampant, embroidered in the most costly style. Under this stood the
chair of state, and near the throne were six splendid chairs placed for
the other members of the royal family. These decorations, and the Hall
being splendidly illuminated, presented to the eye a spectacle of
the most imposing nature, heightened by the brilliant assemblage of
elegantly dressed personages. The Ladies universally wore ostrich
feathers, and the Gentlemen were attired in the most sumptuous dresses.

<p>
About four o'clock, his Majesty having gone through the other fatiguing
ceremonies of the day, entered the Hall with the crown upon his head,
and was greeted with shouts of "Long live the King!" from all quarters;
shortly after which, the banquet was served by the necessary officers.
But that part of the ceremony which most attracted the attention of
Tallyho, was the challenge of the Champion, whose entrance was announced
by the sound of the trumpets thrice; and who having proceeded on a
beautiful horse in a full suit of armour, under the porch of a triumphal
arch, attended by the Duke of Wellington on his right, and the Deputy
Earl Marshal on his left, to the place assigned him, the challenge was
read aloud by the Herald: he then threw down his gauntlet, which having
lain a short time, was returned to him. This ceremony was repeated three
times; when he drank to his Majesty, and received the gold cup and cover
as his fee.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[391]</span> The whole of this magnificent national pageant was conducted
throughout with the most scrupulous attention to the customary etiquette
of such occasions; and Tallyho, who had never witnessed any thing of the
kind before, and consequently could have no conception of its splendour,
was at various parts of the ceremony enraptured; he fancied himself
in Fairy-land, and that every thing he saw and heard was the effect of
enchantment. Our friends returned home highly gratified with their day's
amusement.

    CHAPTER XXV
</h2>
<pre>
          "Behold the Ring! how strange the group appears
          Of dirty blackguards, commoners and peers;
          Jews, who regard not Moses nor his laws,
          All ranks of Christians eager in the cause.
          What eager bets&mdash;what oaths at every breath,
          Who first shall shrink, or first be beat to death.
          Thick fall the blows, and oft the boxers fall,
          While deaf'ning shouts for fresh exertions call;
          Till, bruised and blinded, batter'd sore and maim'd,
          One gives up vanquish'd, and the other lam'd.
          Say, men of wealth! say what applause is due
          For scenes like these, when patronised by you?
          These are your scholars, who in humbler way,
          But with less malice, at destruction play.
          You, like game cocks, strike death with polish'd steel;
          They, dung-hill-bred, use only nature's heel;
          They fight for something&mdash;you for nothing fight;
          They box for love, but you destroy in spite."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[392 ]</span> THE following Tuesday having been appointed by the knowing ones
for a pugilistic encounter between Jack Randall, commonly called the
Nonpareil, and Martin, as well known by the appellation of The Master of
the Rolls, from his profession being that of a baker; an excellent day's
sport was anticipated, and the lads of the fancy were all upon the "<i>qui
vive</i>."
</p>
<p>
Our friends had consequently arranged, on the previous night, to
breakfast at an early hour, and take a gentle ride along the road, with
a determination to see as much as possible of the attractive amusements
of a milling-match, and to take a view as they went along of the company
they were afterwards to mingle with.
</p>
<p>
"We shall now," said Dashall (as they sat down to breakfast) "have a
peep at the lads of the ring, and see a little of the real science of
Boxing."
</p>
<p>
"We have been boxing the compass through the difficult straits of a
London life for some time," replied Bob, "and I begin to think that,
with all its variety, its gaiety, and
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[393]</span> its pride, the most legitimate joys of life may fairly be said to
exist in the country."
</p>
<p>
"I confess," said Dashall, "that most of the pleasures of life are
comparative, and arise from contrast. Thus the bustle of London
heightens the serenity of the country, while again the monotony of the
country gives additional zest to the ever-varying scenes of London. But
why this observation at a moment when we are in pursuit of fresh game?"
</p>
<p>
"Nay," said Tallyho, "I know not why; but I spoke as I thought, feeling
as I do a desire to have a pop at the partridges as the season is now
fast approaching, and having serious thoughts of shifting my quarters."
</p>
<p>
"We will talk of that hereafter," was the reply. "You have an excellent
day's sport in view, let us not throw a cloud upon the prospect before
us&mdash;you seem rather in the doldrums. The amusements of this day will
perhaps inspire more lively ideas; and then we shall be present at the
masquerade, which will doubtless be well attended; all the fashion of
the Metropolis will be present, and there you will find a new world,
such as surpasses the powers of imagination&mdash;a sort of Elysium
unexplored before, full of mirth, frolic, whim, wit and variety, to
charm every sense in nature. But come, we must not delay participating
in immediate gratifications by the anticipations of those intended for
the future. Besides, I have engaged to give the Champion a cast to the
scene of action in my barouche."
</p>
<p>
By this time Piccadilly was all in motion&mdash;coaches, carts, gigs,
tilburies, whiskies, buggies, dog-carts, sociables, dennets, curricles,
and sulkies, were passing in rapid succession, intermingled with
tax-carts and waggons decorated with laurel, conveying company of the
most varied description. In a few minutes, the barouche being at
the door, crack went the whip, and off they bowled. Bob's eyes were
attracted on all sides. Here, was to be seen the dashing Corinthian
tickling up his tits, and his bang-up set-out of blood and bone, giving
the go-by to a heavy drag laden with eight brawney bull-faced blades,
smoking their way down behind a skeleton of a horse, to whom in all
probability a good feed of corn would have been a luxury; pattering
among themselves, occasionally chaffing the more elevated drivers by
whom they were surrounded, and pushing forward their nags with all the
ardour of a British <span class="pagenum">[394]</span> merchant intent upon disposing of a valuable
cargo of foreign goods on 'Change. There, was a waggon, full of all
sorts upon the lark, succeeded by a donkey-cart with four insides; but
Neddy, not liking his burthen, stopt short on the way of a Dandy, whose
horse's head coming plump up to the back of the crazy vehicle at the
moment of its stoppage, threw the rider into the arms of a Dustman, who,
hugging his customer with the determined grasp of a bear, swore d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n
his eyes he had saved his life, and he expected he would stand something
handsome for the Gemmen all round, for if he had not pitched into their
cart, he would certainly have broke his neck; which being complied with,
though reluctantly, he regained his saddle, and proceeded a little more
cautiously along the remainder of the road, while groups of pedestrians
of all ranks and appearances lined each side.
</p>
<p>
At Hyde-Park Corner, Tom having appointed to take up the prime
hammer-man, drew up, and was instantly greeted by a welcome from the
expected party, who being as quickly seated, they proceeded on their
journey.
</p>
<p>
"This match appears to occupy general attention," said Tom.
</p>
<p>
"I should think so," was the reply&mdash;"why it will be a prime thing
as ever was seen. Betting is all alive&mdash;the Daffy Club in tip-top
spirits&mdash;lots of money sported on both sides&mdash;somebody must make a
mull{1}&mdash;but Randall's the man&mdash;he is the favourite of the day, all the
world to a penny-roll."
</p>
<p>
The simile of the penny roll being quite in point with the known title
of one of the combatants, caused a smile on Dashall's countenance, which
was caught by the eye of Tallyho, and created some mirth, as it was
a proof of what has frequently been witnessed, that the lovers of the
fancy are as apt in their imaginations at times, as they are ready for
the accommodating one, two, or the friendly flush hit which floors their
opponents.
</p>
<p>
The morning was fine, and the numerous persons who appeared travelling
on the road called forth many inquiries from Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Now," said he, "I think I recollect that the admirable author of the
<i>Sentimental Journey</i> used to read as he went along&mdash;is it possible to
read as we journey forward?" "Doubtless," replied Tom, "it is, and will
produce
</p>
<pre>
     1 Mull&mdash;Defeat, loss, or disappointment.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[395]</span> a fund of amusing speculation as we jog on. Lavater founded his
judgment of men upon the formation of their features; Gall and Spurzheim
by the lumps, bumps and cavities of their pericraniums; but I doubt not
we shall be right in our views of the society we are likely to meet,
without the help of either&mdash;do you see that group?"
</p>
<p>
Bob nodded assent.
</p>
<p>
"These," continued Tom, "are profitable characters, or rather men of
profit, who, kindly considering the constitution of their friends,
provide themselves with refreshments of various kinds, to supply the
hungry visitors round the ring&mdash;oranges, nuts, apples, gingerbread,
biscuits and peppermint drops."
</p>
<p>
"Not forgetting <i>blue ruin and French lace</i>,"{1} said the man of fist;
"but you have only half done it&mdash;don't you see the <i>Cash-cove</i>{2}
behind, with his stick across his shoulder, <i>padding the hoof</i>{3} in
breathless speed? he has <i>shell'd out the lour</i>{4} for the occasion, and
is travelling down to keep a <i>wakeful winker</i>{5} on his retailers, and
to take care that however they may chuse to lush away the profit, they
shall at least take care of the principal. The little Dandy just before
him also acts as Whipper-in; between them they mark out the ground,{6}
watch the progress, and pocket the proceeds. They lend the money for the
others to traffic."
</p>
<p>
"I confess," said Tom, "I was not exactly up to this."
</p>
<p>
"Aye, aye, but I know the <i>Blunt-monger</i>,{7} and am up to his ways and
means," was the reply.&mdash;"Hallo, my eyes, here he comes!" continued he,
rising from his seat, and bowing obsequiously to a Gentleman who passed
them in a tandem&mdash;"all right, I am glad of it&mdash;always good sport when
he is present&mdash;no want of sauce or seasoning&mdash;he always <i>comes it
strong</i>."{8}
</p>
<p>
"I perceive," replied Tom, "you allude to the noble Marquis of W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>
<pre>
     1 French lace&mdash;A flash or cant term for brandy.

     2 Cash-cove&mdash;A monied man.

     3 Padding the hoof&mdash;Travelling on Shanks's mare, or taking
     a turn by the marrow-bone stage, i.e. walking.

     4 Shell'd out the lour&mdash;Supplied the cash.

     5  Wakeful winker&mdash;A sharp eye.

     6 Mark out the ground&mdash;Is to place his retailers in various
     parts of the Ring for the accommodation of the company, any
     where he may expect to find them himself.

     7 Blunt-monger&mdash;Money-dealer, or money-lender.

     8 Comes it strong&mdash;No flincher, a real good one.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[396]</span> Travelling gently along the road, they were presently impeded by
a crowd of persons who surrounded a long cart or waggon, which had just
been overturned, and had shot out a motley group of personages, who
were being lifted on their legs, growling and howling at this unforeseen
disaster. A hard-featured sailor, whose leg had been broken by the fall,
brandished a splinter of the fractured limb, and swore&mdash;"That although
his timbers were shivered, and he had lost a leg in the service, he
would not be the last in the Ring, but he'd be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d if he mount the
rubbish-cart any more." It is needless to observe his leg was a wooden
one.
</p>
<p>
Upon examining the inscription on the cart, it was found to contain the
following words:&mdash;"Household Furniture, Building Materials, and Lumber
carefully removed." As it was ascertained that no real injury had
been sustained, our party speedily passed the overturned vehicle and
proceeded.
</p>
<p>
The next object of attraction was a small cart drawn by one poor animal,
sweating and snorting under the weight of six Swells, led by an old man,
who seemed almost as incapable as his horse seemed unwilling to perform
the journey. A label on the outside of the cart intimated that its
contents was soap, which created some laughter between Tom and Bob. The
man in the front, whose Jew-looking appearance attracted attention, was
endeavouring to increase the speed of the conveyance by belabouring the
boney rump of the <i>prad</i>{1} with his hat, while some of their pedestrian
<i>palls</i>{2} were following close in the rear, and taking occasionally
a <i>drap of the cratur</i>, which was handed out behind and returned after
refreshment.
</p>
<p>
"These," said Tom to his Cousin, "are also men of profit, but
not exactly in the way of those we passed&mdash;second-rate Swells and
broken-down Gamesters, determined, as the saying is, to have a shy,
even if they lose their sticks, and more properly may be termed men of
plunder; desperate in their pursuits, they turn out with intent to
make the best of the day, and will not fail to nibble all they can come
easily at."
</p>
<p>
"They are not worth the blood from a broken nose," said the Pugilist,
with a feeling for the honour of his profession which did him
credit.&mdash;"They are all prigs, their company
</p>
<pre>
     1 Prad&mdash;A cant term for a horse.

     2 Palls&mdash;Partners, accomplices, colleagues.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[397]</span> spoils all genteel society, and frequently brings disgrace
upon others with whom they are unworthy to associate, or even to be
seen&mdash;there's no getting rid of such gentry. Is it not d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d hard a
man can't have a pleasant bit of a turn-up, without having his friends
filched?&mdash;But here comes the gay fellows, here they come upon the trot,
all eager and anxious to mark the first blow, start the odds, and curry
the coal.{1} These are the lads of life&mdash;true lovers of the sport&mdash;up to
the manouvre&mdash;clear and quick-sighted, nothing but good ones&mdash;aye aye,
and here comes Bill Gibbons, furnished with the fashionables."
</p>
<p>
"What do you call the fashionables?" inquired Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Why, the Binders."
</p>
<p>
Here he was as much at a loss as ever, which the other perceiving, he
continued&mdash;"The Binders are the stakes and ropes, to fence in the Ring."
</p>
<p>
Bill Gibbons, who was well known on the road, and was speeding down
pretty sharp, was followed by crowds of vehicles of all descriptions; as
many to whom the place of meeting was but conjectured, upon seeing
him felt assured of being in the right track. Here were to be seen the
Swells in their tandems&mdash;the Nib Sprigs in their gigs, buggies, and
dog-carts&mdash;and the Tidy Ones on their trotters, all alive and leaping.
Mirth and merriment appeared spread over every countenance, though
expectation and anxiety were intermingled here and there in the features
of the real lads of the fancy; many of whom, upon this very interesting
occasion, had bets to a considerable amount depending upon the result of
the day. The bang-up blades were pushing their prads along in gay style,
accompanied by two friends, that is to say, a biped and a quadruped. The
queer fancy lads, who had hired hacks from the livery-stable keepers,
were kicking up a dust, and here and there rolling from their prancers
in their native soil; while the neck or nothing boys, with no prospect
but a whereas before their eyes, were as heedless of their personal
safety as they were of their Creditor's property. Jaded hacks and crazy
vehicles were to be seen on all sides&mdash;here lay a bankrupt-cart with
the panels knock'din, and its driver with an eye knock'd out, the horse
lamed, and the concern completely knock'd up, just before the period
when the hammer of the Auctioneer was to be called in, and his effects
knock'd down. There was another
</p>
<pre>
     1 Curry the coal&mdash;Make sure of the money.
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[398]</span> of the same description, with a harum-scarum devil of
a half-bred, making his way at all risks, at a full gallop, as
unmanageable in his career as his driver had been in his speculations;
dust flying, women sprawling, men bawling, dogs barking, and the
multitude continually increasing. Scouts, Scamps, Lords, Loungers and
Lacqueys&mdash;Coster-mongers from&mdash;To the Hill Fields&mdash;and The Bloods from
Bermondsey, completely lined the road as far as the eye could reach,
both before and behind; it was a day of the utmost importance to the
pugilistic school, as the contest had excited a most unparalleled degree
of interest!
</p>
<p>
It would be scarcely possible to give a full and accurate description
of the appearances as they went along; imagination would labour in vain,
and words are altogether incapable of conveying a picture of the road to
this memorable fight; the various instances in which they could discover
that things were not all right were admirably contrasted by others,
where care and good coachmanship, with a perfect management of the
bloods, proved the reverse&mdash;while the single horsemen, whose hearts were
really engaged in the sport, were picking their way with celerity, and
posting to the point of attraction.&mdash;The public-houses were thronged
to excess, and the Turnpike-keepers made a market of the mirth-moving
throng.

">
</center>

<p>
Our party arrived in the neighbourhood of Copthorne about half-past
twelve, where all was bustle and confusion. The commissary in chief, Mr.
Jackson, being out of town, some of the subalterns, who had taken the
command <i>pro tempore</i>, had, for divers weighty reasons,principally
founded on a view to the profits of certain of the Surrey Trusts, and to
accommodate the sporting circles at Brighton, fixed the combat to take
place in a meadow belonging to a farmer named Jarvis, near this place.
</p>
<p>
On this spot accordingly the ring was formed, and an immense mass of
all descriptions of vehicles was admitted, not much, it may naturally
be supposed, to the prejudice of the owner of the premises, whose
agents were praise-worthily active in levying proper contributions. Some
Gentlemen however in the neighbourhood, observing that the strictest
delicacy was not maintained towards the sacredness of their fences,
insisted that the place was too confined, and intimated that a move must
be made, or they should make application to the Magistrates; and at
the same time suggested Crawley Downs, the site of so <span class="pagenum">[399]</span> many former
skirmishes, as the most convenient spot for their accommodation.
</p>
<p>
In this state of things, a move immediately took place, and a fresh
ring was established on the spot alluded to; but, in effecting this new
lodgment, much mortification was experienced, not alone by those, who,
after a dreadful drag up one of the worst by-roads in England, had
obtained a comfortable situation, but by those, who, speculating on the
formation of the ring, had expended considerable sums in the hire of
waggons for their purpose from the surrounding farmers. The waggons
it was found impossible to move in due time, and thus the new area was
composed of such vehicles as were first to reach the appointed ground.
</p>
<p>
The general confusion now was inconceivable, for, notwithstanding the
departure of connoisseurs from Jarvis's Farm, Martin still maintained
his post, alleging, that he was on the ground originally fixed, and
that he should expect Randall to meet him there; in which demand he was
supported by his backers. This tended to increase the embarrassment of
the amateurs; however, about one, Randall arrived at Crawley Downs, in
a post-chaise, and took up his quarters at a cottage near the ground,
waiting for his man; and at two, General Barton, who had just mounted
his charger, intending to consult the head-quarters of the Magistrates,
to ascertain their intention in case of proceeding to action at Jarvis's
Farm, was suddenly arrested in his progress by an express from the
Martinites, announcing that their champion had yielded his claim to the
choice of ground, and was so anxious for the mill, that he would meet
Randall even in a saw-pit. Bill Gibbons arriving soon after, the Ring,
with the assistance of many hands, was quickly formed; by which time,
Tom and Bob had secured themselves excellent situations to view the
combat.
</p>
<p>
About twenty minutes before three, Randall entered the outer Ring,
attended by General Barton and Mr. Griffiths. He was attired in a
Whitehall upper Benjamin, and <i>threw his hat into the Ring</i> amidst loud
applause. In a few minutes after, Martin approached from an opposite
direction, accompanied by Mr. Sant and Mr. Elliott; he was also warmly
greeted.
</p>
<p>
The men now passed the ropes, and were assisted by their immediate
friends in peeling for action. Martin was <span class="pagenum">[400]</span> attended by Spring and
Thurton; Randall, by Harry Holt and Paddington Jones.
</p>
<p>
The men stript well, and both appeared to be in excellent health, good
spirits, and high condition; but the symmetry of Randall's bust excited
general admiration; and the muscular strength of his arms, neck, and
shoulders, bore testimony to his Herculean qualities; the whole force of
his body, in fact, seem'd to be concentrated above his waistband. Martin
stood considerably above him, his arms were much longer, but they wanted
that bold and imposing weight which characterized those of Randall. They
walked up to the <i>scratch</i>, and shook hands in perfect good fellowship.
Every man now took his station, and the heroes threw themselves into
their guard.
</p>
<p>
It was rumoured that Martin intended to lose no time in manoeuvring, but
to go to work instanter. This however he found was not so easily to
be effected as suggested, for Randall had no favour to grant, and was
therefore perfectly on his guard. He was all wary caution, and had
clearly no intention of throwing away a chance, but was evidently
waiting for Martin to commence. Martin once or twice made play, but
Randall was not skittishly inclined, all was "war hawk." Randall made a
left-handed hit to draw his adversary, but found it would not do.
Martin then hit right and left, but was stopped. Randall was feeling for
Martin's wind, but hit above his mark, though not without leaving one of
a red colour, which told "a flattering tale." Randall returned with his
left, and the men got to a smart rally, when Randall got a konker, which
tapped the claret. An almost instantaneous close followed, in which
Randall, grasping Martin round the neck with his right arm, and bringing
his head to a convenient posture, sarved out punishment with his left.
This was indeed a terrific position. Randall was always famous for the
dreadful force of his short left-handed hits, and on this occasion they
lost none of their former character. Martin's nob was completely in a
vice; and while in that hopeless condition, Randall fibbed away with the
solid weight of the hammer of a tuck-mill. His aim was principally at
the neck, where every blow told with horrible violence. Eight or ten
times did he repeat the dose, and then, with a violent swing, threw
Martin to the ground, falling on him as he; went with all his weight.
The Ring resounded with applause, and Jack coolly took <span class="pagenum">[401]</span> his seat
on the knee of his Second. Martin's friends began to look blue, but
still expected, the fight being young, there was yet much to be done.
</p>
<p>
All eyes were now turned to Martin, who being lifted on Spring's knee,
in a second discovered that he was done. His head fell back lifeless,
and all the efforts of Spring to keep it straight were in vain. Water
was thrown on him in abundance, but without effect: he was, in fact,
completely senseless; and the half-minute having transpired, the
Nonpareil was hailed the victor.
</p>
<p>
Randall appeared almost without a scratch, while poor Martin lay like a
lump of unleavened dough; he was removed and bled, but it was some time
before he was conscious of his defeat.
</p>
<p>
Nothing could exceed the astonishment which so sudden and complete a
finish to the business produced. The round lasted but seven minutes and
a half, of which four minutes and a half had elapsed before a blow was
attempted. Thus ended one of the most extraordinary battles between two
known game men on the pugilistic records. Very heavy bets had been made
upon it in all parts of the kingdom. One gentleman is said to have had
five thousand pounds, and another one thousand eight hundred guineas.
The gains of the conqueror were supposed to be about a thousand pounds.
</p>
<p>
The amusements of the day were concluded by a second fight between
Parish and Lashbroke, which proved a manly and determined contest for
upwards of an hour, and in which the combatants evinced considerable
skill and bravery, and was finally decided in favour of Parish. All
amusement which might have been derived from this spectacle, however,
was completely destroyed by the daring outrages of an immense gang of
pickpockets, who broke in the Ring, and closed completely up to the
ropes, carrying with them every person, of decent appearance, and openly
robbing them of their watches, pocket-books and purses. And the lateness
of the hour, it being five o'clock, and almost dark, favoured the
depredators.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of this struggle, Tom Dashall had nearly lost his fancy
topper,{1} and Tallyho was secretly eased of his clicker.{2} From the
scene of tumult and confusion they were glad to escape; and being again
safely seated in the

<span class="pagenum">[402]</span> barouche, they made the best of their way home; in doing which,
they found the roads almost as much clogg'd as they were in the morning.
The Randallites were meritorious, and, flushed with good fortune, lined
the public-houses on the road to <i>wet their whistles</i>, singing and
shouting his name in strains to them equally inspiring as
</p>
<pre>
          "See the conquering hero comes!
          Sound your trumpets, beat your drums;"
</pre>
<p>
while the Martinites rolled along the road in sullen silence; and, by
the time they reached town, an account of the Battle was hawking about
the streets, and songs singing to the praise of the successful combatant
in all the melodious cadences of a last dying speech and confession:
such is the promptitude of London Printers, Poets, and News-venders.
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Dashall, as they re-entered the house, "the events of this
day have completely disappointed some of the knowing ones."
</p>
<p>
"That may be," replied Bob, "but they have been too knowing for me,
notwithstanding your previous instructions. However, I don't regret
seeing the humours of a Prize Ring; and the next time you catch me
there, I must take a lesson from the man of profit, and keep a wakeful
winker on the possibles. Really, I could not help feeling astonished at
the immense number of persons assembled on such an occasion."

<p>
"Zounds!" said Tom, "'tis the real centre of attraction, the thing,
the tippy, and the twig, among the Lads of the Fancy. Why, it is pretty
generally known, through the medium of the newspapers, that a certain
Nobleman paid the debts of one of these Pugilists, amounting to 300L.
that he might be released from Newgate in order to fight a prize battle;
and it is not long since that the Marquis of T&mdash;ed&mdash;e, whilst
entertaining a large party, after dinner introduced the subject with so
much effect, that a purse of 100 guineas was subscribed among them for a
turn up between two of the <i>prime hammermen</i>; who, being introduced,
actually set-to in his drawing-room for the amusement of his friends.
Nor is it less true, that this sporting Nobleman gloriously took up the
conqueror, (as the saying is) and evinced his patronage and his power at
once, by actually subduing his antagonist, proving to certitude, that if
his Lordship would but practise this sublime art, he <span class="pagenum">[403]</span> could hardly
fail of adding to his present title that of the Champion of England! It
is the theme of constant conversation, and in many cases there is more
anxiety about contests of this sort than there is about the arrival of a
Monarch on the Irish coast among the lads of <i>praties</i>, whiskey, and
buttermilk&mdash;thoughts are busy, energies are active&mdash;and money in galore
is circulated upon it."
</p>
<p>
Bob laughed heartily at these observations of his Cousin upon what he
termed the sublime art.
</p>
<p>
"You don't appear to enter into the spirit of it," continued Tom; "but
I can assure you, it is a very animating subject, and has occupied the
attention of all classes, from the peer to the prelate, the peasant
and the pot-boy; it is said that one of the lower order of ranting
Preachers, not many miles from Bolton-on-the-Moors, lately addressed
his auditory in the following metaphorical language, accompanied with
striking and appropriate attitudes:&mdash;'I dare say, now, you'd pay to see
a boxing-match between Randall and Turner, or Martin&mdash;yet you don't like
to pay for seeing a pitched-battle between me and the Black Champion
Beelzebub. Oh! my friends, many a hard knock, and many a cross-buttock
have I given the arch bruiser of mankind&mdash;aye, and all for your dear
sakes&mdash;pull&mdash;do pull off those gay garments of Mammon, strike the devil
a straight-forward blow in the mouth, darken his spiritual daylights.
At him manfully, give it him right and left, and I'll be your
bottle-holder&mdash;I ask nothing but the money, which you'll not forget
before you go.' "
</p>
<p>
"The true spirit moved him," said Bob, "and a very laudable one too; but
he very emphatically deprecated the votaries of Mammon."
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, he being called, would have been unworthy of his calling if
he had not."
</p>
<p>
This conversation was carried on over a glass of generous wine, and,
dwindling into indifferent subjects, is not necessary to be detailed;
suffice it to say, that, fatigued with the day's exertions, they sought
repose in the arms of Morpheus at an early hour, determined on the
pursuit of fresh game with the dawn of the morning.<span class="pagenum">[404]</span>

    CHAPTER XXVI
</h2>
<pre>
          "See yonder beaux, so delicately gay;
          And yonder belles, so'deck'd in thin array&mdash;
          Ah! rather see not what a decent pride
          Would teach a maiden modestly to hide;
          The dress so flimsy, the exposure such,
          "twould almost make a very wanton blush.
          E'en married dames, forgetting what is due
          To sacred ties, give half clad charms to view.
          What calls them forth to brave the daring glance,
          The public ball, the midnight wanton dance?
          There many a blooming nymph, by fashion led,
          Has felt her health, her peace, her honour fled;
          Truss'd her fine form to strange fantastic shapes,
          To be admir'd, and twirl'd about by apes;
          Or, mingling in the motley masquerade,
          Found innocence by visor'd vice betrayed."
</pre>
<p>
AN agreeable lounge through the Parks in the morning afforded them an
opportunity of recalling in idea the pleasures of the past Real Life in
London, of which Tallyho had been enabled to partake, and during which
he again signified a desire to change the scene, by a departure at
an early period for his native vales, to breathe, as he observed, the
uncontaminated air of the country&mdash;to watch the wary pointer, and mark
the rising covey&mdash;to pursue the timid hare, or chase the cunning
fox; and Dashall finding him inflexible, notwithstanding his glowing
descriptions of scenes yet unexplored, at length consented to accompany
him to Belville Hall, upon condition that they should return again in
a month. This mode of arrangement seemed perfectly satisfactory to Bob;
and a view of the Panorama and a peep at the Tennis Court would have
finished their rambles for the day, but at the latter place of
amusement and healthful exercise, meeting with young Mortimer, a further
developement of facts relative to Sparkle and his Bride transpired; in
which it appeared that they had arrived at their place of destination,
and had forwarded an invitation to his brother-in-law to <span class="pagenum">[405]</span> pay them
an early visit, and who proposed starting in a few days.
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Dashall, "we will all go together, and no doubt with our
old friend Sparkle we shall be able to endure the unchanging prospects
of a country life."
</p>
<pre>
          "In the Country how blest, when it rains in the fields,
          To feast upon transports that shuttle-cock yields;
          Or go crawling from window to window, to see
          An ass on a common, a crow on a tree.

          In the Country you're nail'd, like some pale in your park,
          To some stick of a neighbour, crammed into the ark;
          And if you are sick, or in fits tumble down,
          You reach death ere the Doctor can reach you from town."
</pre>
<p>
"Never mind," cried Tallyho, "a change of scene will no doubt be useful,
and, at all events, by enduring the one, we may learn more judiciously
to appreciate the other."
</p>
<p>
"True," said Tom, "and I shall like myself all the better for being
in good company. But pray, Mr. Mortimer, what do you mean to do at the
approaching masquerade?"
</p>
<p>
"Not quite decided yet," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
"You go, of course?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly&mdash;as Orpheus, or Apollo. But pray what character do you intend
to sustain?"
</p>
<p>
"That's a secret&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Worth knowing, I suppose&mdash;well, well, I shall find you out, never
fear."
</p>
<p>
"Time's a tell-tale," said Dashall, "and will most likely unfold all
mysteries; but I always think the life and spirit of a masquerade is
much injured by a knowledge of the characters assumed by friends, unless
it be where two or more have an intention of playing, as it were,
to, and with each other; for where there is mystery, there is always
interest. I shall therefore propose that we keep to ourselves the
characters in which we mean to appear; for I am determined, if possible,
to have a merry night of it."
</p>
<pre>
          "On the lightly sportive wing,
          At pleasure's call we fly;
          Hark! they dance, they play, they sing,
          In merry merry revelry;
          Hark! the tabors lively beat,
          And the flute in numbers sweet,
          Fill the night with delight
          At the Masquerade.
          Let the grave ones warn us as they may,
          Of every harmless joy afraid;
          Whilst we're young and gay,
          We'll frolic and play
          At the Masquerade."
</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[406]</span> Tom's observations upon this subject were in perfect accordance
with those of. Mortimer and Tallyho; though he had intended to consult
his Cousin as to the character he should appear in, he now determined
to take his own direction, or to have advice from Fentum in the Strand,
whose advertisements to supply dresses, &amp;c. he had observed in the
newspapers.
</p>
<p>
These preliminaries being decided upon, as far as appeared needful at
the moment, Mortimer departed towards home, where he expected to meet
his Uncle upon his return from the chase after the fugitives, Sparkle
and Miss Mortimer, now Mrs. Sparkle; and Tom and Bob to Piccadilly,
where a select party of Dashall's friends were invited to dinner, and
where they enjoyed a pleasant evening, drank rather freely, and had but
little to regret after it, except certain qualmish feelings of the head
and stomach the next morning.
</p>
<p>
The anticipated Masquerade had been the principal subject of
conversation, so long as reason held her sway; but the hard exercise of
the arm, and the generosity of the wine, had an early and visible effect
upon some of the party, who did not separate till a late hour, leaving
Bob just strength and intelligence enough to find the way to his
dormitory.
</p>
<p>
By the arrival of the appointed evening for the grand Masquerade at
Vauxhall Gardens, Tom Dashall, who had a particular view in keeping
his intended proceedings a secret, had arranged all to his wishes, and
anticipated considerable amusement from the interest he should take
in the safety of his Cousin, whom he entertained no doubt of quickly
discovering, and with whom he determined to promote as much mirth as
possible.
</p>
<p>
Tallyho, in the mean time, had also made occasional calls upon Merrywell
in his confinement, and, under his direction, been preparing for the
occasion, equally determined, if possible, to turn the laugh on his
Cousin; <span class="pagenum">[407]</span> and it must be acknowledged, he could scarcely have
found a more able tutor, though he was doomed rather to suffer by
his confidence in his instructor, as will hereafter be seen; for, in
escaping the intended torment of one, he was unexpectedly subjected to
the continual harassing of another.
</p>
<p>
It was about half after eleven o'clock, when Tallyho, duly equipped in
his country costume, as a Huntsman, entered this splendid and spacious
scene of brilliancy. The blaze of light which burst upon him, and the
variety of characters in constant motion, appeared almost to render him
motionless; and several of the would-be characters passed him with a
vacant stare, declaring he was no character at all! nor was he roused
from his lethargic position till he heard a view halloo, which seemed
to come from a distant part of the Garden, and was so delivered, as
actually to give him an idea of the party being in pursuit of game, by
growing fainter towards the close, as if receding from him. The sound
immediately animated him, and answering it in a truly sportsman-like
style, he burst from his situation, and cracking his whip, at full speed
followed in the direction from which it came, under the impression that
he knew the voice of Dashall, and should discover him. In his speed,
however, he was rather rudely attacked by a small dandy personage,
whose outward appearance indicated some pretensions to manhood, with a
"Demmee, Sir, how dare you be rude to my voman! for egad I shall have
you clapped in the Round-house&mdash;here, Vatchman, take this here man in
charge&mdash;Vatch! Vatch!" The voice however soon told him he had a lady to
deal with, and he entered into a long harangue by way of apology. This
not being acceptable to the offended party, he was surrounded by a host
of Charleys springing their rattles all at once, and, notwithstanding
the dexterous use of his whip, he was obliged to yield. At this moment,
Tallyho was again sounded in his ears, issuing from another quarter; but
his struggles to pursue the party from whom it came were ineffectual. A
rough-hewn Sailor with a pipe in his mouth, and an immense cudgel in
his hand, however, arrived to his assistance, accompanied by an Irish
Chairman in a large blue coat, and a cock'd hat bound with gold lace,
armed with a chair-pole, who effected his liberty; and he again scoured
off in pursuit <span class="pagenum">[408]</span> of his friend, but without success. He now began
to think his situation not altogether so pleasant as he could wish. He
listened to every voice, examined every form that passed him in rapid
succession; yet he felt himself alone, and determined not to be led away
by sounds such as had already occupied his attention, but rather to look
about him, and notice the eccentricities with which he was surrounded.
Sauntering along in this mood, he was presently assailed by a voice
behind him, exclaiming, "Bob&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Bob, if you wish to go safely on,
          Tarn round about, and look out for the Don."
</pre>
<p>
Upon hearing this, he turned hastily around, and encountered a group
of Chimney-sweepers, who immediately set up such a clatter with their
brushes and shovels, dancing at the same time in the true May-day style
round him and a strapping Irish fish-woman, that he was completely
prevented from pursuit, and almost from observation, while a universal
laugh from those near him bespoke the mirth his situation excited; and
the Hibernian damsel, with true Irish sympathy, attempted to allay his
chagrin by clasping him in her brawny arms, and imprinting on his ruddy
cheek a kiss. This only served to heighten their merriment and increase
his embarrassment, particularly as his <i>Cher ami</i> swore she had not had
a buss like it since the death of her own dear dead and departed Phelim,
the last of her four husbands, who died of a whiskey fever, bawling for
pratees and buttermilk, and was waked in a coal-shed.
</p>
<p>
This mark of the Lady's favour was not so favourably received by
Tallyho, and, determined to make his escape, he gave Moll a violent
fling from him, overturned her and her basket, knock'd down two of the
Chimney-sweepers, and then with a leap as if he had been springing at
a five-barred gate, jumped over his late companion, who lay sprawling
among the flue-fakers, and effected his purpose, to the inexpressible
amusement of those, who, after enjoying a hearty laugh at him, now
transferred their risibility to those he left behind. Finding himself
once more unshackled, he smack'd his whip with enthusiasm, and repeated
his Tallyho with increased effect; for it was immediately answered, and,
without waiting for its final close, he found the person from whom it
was <span class="pagenum">[409]</span> proceeding to be no other than a Turk, who was precipitately
entering one of the rooms, and was as quickly recognized by him to be
the Hon. Tom Dashall. The alteration which a Turkish turban and pelisse
had effected in his person, would however have operated as an effectual
bar to this discovery, had he not seized him in the very moment of
vociferation; and although his Cousin had been the chief cause of the
adventures he had already met with, he had at the same time kept an eye
upon Bob, and been equally instrumental in effecting his release from
embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
"Come," said Tom, "I am for a little gig in the Room&mdash;how long have
you been here?&mdash;I thought I should find you out, very few can disguise
themselves from me; we will now be spectators for half an hour, and
enjoy the mirth excited by others."
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart," rejoined Bob, "for I am almost as tired already as
if I had spent a whole day in a fox-chase, and have run as many risks
of my neck; so that a cool half hour's observation will be very
acceptable."
</p>
<p>
They had scarcely entered the Room, as a Priscilla Tomboy passed them at
full speed with a skipping-rope, for whose accommodation every one made
way; and who, having skipped round the room to shew her fine formed
ancle and flexibility of limbs, left it for a moment, and returned with
a large doll, which she appeared as pleased with as a child of eight
or ten years of age. A Jemmy Jumps assured Tom, that his garments
were altogether unsuitable to the nation in which he was residing, and
recommended that he should not exist another day without that now very
fashionable appendage of a Gentleman's dress called stays&mdash;An excellent
Caleb Quotem, by his smartness of repartee and unceasing volubility of
speech in recounting his labours of a day&mdash;"a summer's day," as the poet
says, afforded much amusement by his powers of out-talking the fribble
of a Staymaker, who, finding himself confused by his eternal clack, fled
in search of another customer. A Don Quixote was conferring the honour
of knighthood on a clumsy representative of the God of Love, and
invoking his aid in return, to accomplish the object of finding his
lost Dulcinea. An outlandish fancy-dressed character was making an
assignation with a Lady, who, having taken the veil and renounced the
sex, kindly consented to forego <span class="pagenum">[410]</span> her vows and meet him again;
while a Devil behind her was hooking the cock'd-hat of the gay deceiver
to the veil of the Nun, which created considerable laughter, for as
they attempted to separate, they were both completely unmasked, and
discovered, to the amazement of Tallyho, two well-known faces, little
expected there by him&mdash;no other than Merrywell as the Dandy Officer, and
his friend Mr. Safebind as the Nun. The exposure rather confused
them, while Tom and Bob joined the merry Devil in a loud burst of
laughter&mdash;they however bustled through the room and were quickly lost.

<p>
A French <i>Frisseur</i>, without any knowledge of the language of the nation
from which he appeared to come, could only answer a question <i>a la
Françoise</i> from the accomplished Tom Dashall, by a volume of scented
powder from his puff, which being observed by a Chimney-sweeper,
was returned by dust of another colour from his soot-bag, till the
intermixture of white and black left it difficult to decide which was
the Barber and which the Sweep. They were now suddenly attracted by a
grotesque dance between a Clown of the Grimaldi school and a fancy Old
Woman in a garment of patch-work made in an ancient fashion. A red nose,
long rows of beads for ear-rings, and a pair of spectacles surmounted by
a high cauled-cap, decorated with ribbons of various hues, rendered
her the most conspicuous character in the room: and notwithstanding
her high-heeled shoes, she proved herself an excellent partner for the
Clown.
</p>
<p>
By this time, Bob, who was anxious to carry his plan into execution,
began to be fidgetty, and proposed a walk into the open air again. As
they left the room, his ears were attracted by the following song by a
Watchman, which he could not help stopping to catch, and which afforded
his Cousin an excellent opportunity of giving him the slip:
</p>
<pre>
          "Fly, ye prigs,{1} for now's the hour,
          (Tho' boosey kids{2} have lost their power,)
          When watchful Charleys,{3} like the Sun,
          Their nightly course of duty run
          Beneath the pale-faced moon;

     1 Prigs&mdash;Pickpockets.

     2 Boosey kids&mdash;Drunken men.

     3 Charleys&mdash;A cant term for watchmen.

          But take this warning while ye fly,
          That if you nibble, click,{1} or clye,{2}
          My sight's so dim, I cannot see,
          Unless while you the blunt{3} tip me:
          Then stay, then stay;
          For I shall make this music speak,{4}
          And bring you up before the Beak,{5}
          Unless the chink's in tune.

          Now, ye rambling sons of night,
          Or peep-o'-day boys{6} on your flight,
          Well prim'd with Jack or Child Tom's juice,
          While you the silver key{7} produce,
          Your safety then is clear.
          But snuffy,{8} and not up to snuff,{9}
          You'll And your case is queer enough;
          Shell out the nonsense;{10} half a quid{11}
          Will speak more truth than all your whid:{12}

          Then go, then go;
          For, if you linger on your way,
          You'll for my music dearly pay,
          I'll quod you, never fear."
</pre>
<p>
Turning round with laughter from this character, who had attracted many
hearers, he look'd in vain for Dashall, and was not displeased to find
he had fled. He therefore hastily withdrew from the scene of merriment,
and according to the instructions previously received, and for which
he had prepared, quickly changed his dress, and appeared again in the
character of a Judge, under the impression hinted by his counsellor,
that the gravity of his wig and gown, with a steady countenance,

     to open all places, and all hearts.

          "If you are sick and like to die,

          Or have the cholic in your eye,
          Still money is your friend&mdash;is it not?"

</pre>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[412]</span> would be a quiet and peaceable part to get through, and shield
him from the torment of those whom Bob suspected willing to play tricks
with him should he be discovered. Here however he again found himself
at fait, for he had scarcely entered the Gardens, before a host of
depredators were brought before him for trial. The Charleys brought in
succession, drunken Fiddlers, Tinkers and Barbers; and appeals were
made to his patience in so many voices, and under so many varying
circumstances, that Justice was nearly running mad, and poor Tallyho
could find no chance of making a reply. An uproar from the approaching
crowd, announced some more than ordinary culprit; and, in a moment, who
should appear before him but a Don Giovanni, and the hooking Devil, Here
was a fine case for decision; the Devil claimed the Don as his property,
and addressed the Representative of Justice as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Most learned and puissant Judge!
</p>
<p>
"Protect my rights as you would the rights of man; I claim my property,
and will have my claim allowed."
</p>
<p>
"Hold," replied Bob, "if that is the case, you have no occasion to
appeal to me&mdash;begone, black wretch, and in thy native shades yell forth
thy discordant screams."
</p>
<p>
"Most righteous Judge!&mdash;a second Daniel!" cried a bearded Shylock, with
his knife and scales, "he shan't escape me&mdash;I'll have my bond&mdash;so bare
his bosom 'next the heart'&mdash;let me come near him."
</p>
<p>
"This is playing the Devil, indeed," said the Don.
</p>
<p>
"By the Powers!" cried a 'Looney Mackwolteb,' "he's jump'd out of the
fire into the frying-pan; and, when the Smouchee has done wid him, he
may be grill'd in his own fat."
</p>
<p>
At this moment, a Leporello, who caught the last words of the Irishman,
burst into the presence of the Judge, singing&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Zounds, Sir, they'll grill you now, lean or fat, I know what games you
were always at, And told you before what harm you would hatch: Now the
old Gentleman's found you out, He'll clap us all in the round-about; Let
us be off, ere they call for the Watch."
</p>
<p>
The word Watch was re-echoed in a thousand voices; the vociferations of
the callers, the noise of the rattles, <span class="pagenum">[413]</span> and the laughter of
those immediately surrounding the judgment-seat, offered so good an
opportunity for escape, that Giovanni, determining to have another
chance, burst from the grasp of the arch enemy of mankind, to pursue
his wonted vagaries, to the no small gratification of Bob, who, without
actually acquitting the prisoner, rejoiced at his own escape.
</p>
<p>
He had however scarcely time to congratulate himself, before he was
annoyed by a Postman, in the usual costume, whom he had already seen
delivering letters to the company; the contents of which appeared to
afford considerable amusement; and who, presenting a letter addressed
to The Lord Chief Justice Bunglecause, in a moment disappeared. Breaking
open the envelope, he read with astonishment the following lines:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Tho' justice prevails
          Under big wigs and tails,
          You've not much of law in your nob;
          So this warning pray take,
          Your big wig forsake,
          And try a more modern scratch, Bob."
</pre>
<p>
"Go along Bob&mdash;Lord Chief Justice Bob in a scratch," cried a Waterman
at his elbow, (who had heard him reading) in a voice loud enough to be
heard at some distance.
</p>
<p>
"There he'll be at home to a hair," squeaked a little finicking
personification of a modern Peruquier, sidling up to him, picking his
teeth with a tortoise-shell comb.
</p>
<p>
Bob, in bursting hastily away, under the reiterated cries of "Go along
Bob&mdash;Lord Chief Justice Bob," with the idea of overtaking the Postman,
found himself in a moment lock'd in the close embraces of a Meg
Merrilies; while a little bandy-legg'd representative of the late Sir
Jeffery Dunstan, bawling out, Ould wigs, Ould wigs, made a snatch at the
grave appendage of Justice, and completely dismantled the head of its
august representative. This delayed him in his progress, but it was
merely to witness the wig flying in the air, with as much mirth to the
surrounding company as when the greasy night-cap of the Rev. George
Harvest was toss'd about the pit at the theatre, each one giving it a
swing who could get within reach of it. Thus mutilated in his <span class="pagenum">[414]</span>
apparel, and probably conceiving, according to the song,
</p>
<pre>
          "The wig's the thing, the wig, the wig,
          The wisdom's in the wig,"
</pre>
<p>
Bob Tallyho took flight into a dressing-room, declaring justice was
abroad and propriety not at home. He was however rather at a loss, as
in his last character he had not been able to meet with the Turk, but
determined to resume the search in a 'Domino. Having therefore equipped
himself as a spectator, he again sallied forth with intention to explore
the room, and for a time remained comparatively unmolested; but as he
could no where find his Cousin, he strolled indiscriminately among the
characters, viewing whatever appeared amusing or interesting in his
way. The fineness of the weather greatly animated the scene, and
gave increased brilliancy and effect to the illuminations, which
were disposed in a numerous variety of splendid devices, representing
national trophies, stars, wreaths, and crowns of laurel. It was the
first moment he had found an opportunity of viewing the place in which
he had been acting.
</p>
<p>
The amusements of the evening were judiciously varied, and protracted
by a constant succession of entertainments of various descriptions. Mr.
Chalons exhibited many of his most surprising deceptions in the rotunda;
where also young Gyngell displayed some capital performances on the
slack-wire. In the long room the celebrated fantoccini exhibition, with
groupes of quadrille dancers, enlivened the scene. In one walk of the
garden, Mr. Gyngell's theatre of arts was erected, where were exhibited
balancing, the <i>Ombres Chinoises</i>, gymnastic exercises, and other
feats, and Mr. Gyngell performed several airs on the musical glasses; in
another, Punchinello delighted the beholders with his antics; in a
third a very expert Juggler played a variety of clever tricks and
sleight-of-hand deceptions, and a couple of itinerant Italians exhibited
their musical and mechanical show-boxes; in another part of the gardens
the celebrated Diavolo Antonio went through his truly astonishing
evolutions on the <i>corde volante</i>. The Duke of Gloucester's fine
military band occupied the grand orchestra; an excellent quadrille band
played throughout the night in the long room, while a Scottish reel
band in the rotunda, and <span class="pagenum">[415]</span> a Pandean band in the gardens, played
alternately reels, waltzes, and country dances.
</p>
<p>
This interval of peace was truly acceptable to Bob, and he did not fail
to make the most of it, roving like the bee from one delight to another,
sipping pleasure as he went, almost regretting he had not taken the last
dress first, though he was every now and then importuned by Mendicants
and Servant girls, very desirous to obtain places of all work. The
introduction of a Dancing Bear, who appeared to possess more Christian
qualities than his Leader, attracted his attention; but, in pressing to
the scene of action, he received a floorer from a Bruiser in gloves, who
mill'd indiscriminately all who came in his way, till the Bear took the
shine out of him by a fraternal embrace; and his Leader very politely
asked those around which they thought the greater bear of the two. Upon
rising, Bob found himself in the hands of two itinerant Quack Doctors,
each holding an arm, and each feeling for his pulse. One declared the
case was mortal, a dislocation of the neck had taken place, and there
was no chance of preserving life except by amputation of the head.
The other shook his head, look'd grave, pull'd out his lancet, and
prescribed phlebotomy and warm water.
</p>
<p>
Bob, who had received no injury, except a little contusion occasioned by
the blow, seized the ignorant practitioners by the throat, and knocking
their heads together, exclaimed with a stentorian voice,
</p>
<p>
"Throw physic to the clogs, I'll none on't." "Go along Bob," was
repeated again, as loud and as long as before; he however burst from
those around him in pursuit of fresh game; nor was he disappointed, for
he presently found a dapper young Clergyman in gown and surplice,
and who, with book in hand, was fervently engaged in exhortations and
endeavours to turn from the evil of their ways a drunken Sailor and
a hardened thief, (the Orson of the Iron Chest,) when the group were
surrounded by a detachment of the Imps and Devils of Giovanni in London,
a truly horrid and diabolical crew, who, by their hideous yells, frantic
capers, violent gestures, and the flaring of their torches, scared the
affrighted Parson from his task, made his intended penitents their own,
and became an almost intolerable <span class="pagenum">[416]</span> nuisance to the rest of the
company for the remainder of the evening.
</p>
<p>
While he was thus engaged, the supper-boxes were thrown open, and the
company appeared to be all on the move towards the more substantial
entertainments of the evening. He was next suddenly detained by a Jew
Pedlar, who was anxious to shew him his wares.
</p>
<p>
"Get out, Smouchee," said Bob.
</p>
<p>
"Ant is dat all vat you can say to a poor honesht Jew, what vants to
live by his 'trade, for vye you trow my religionsh in my teeth? I'm so
honesht vat I never cheats nobody&mdash;vill you puy a gould&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l Vat you
take for your gown? I shall puy or sell, it's all the same to me.
</p>
<p>
"Now whatsoever country by chance I travel through, 'Tis all the same to
I, so the monies but comes in; Some people call me tief, just because I
am a Jew; So to make them tell the truth, vy I tinks there is no sin. So
I shows them all mine coots vid a sober, winning grace, And I sometimes
picks dere pockets whilst they're smiling in my face."
</p>
<p>
Bob laugh'd, but declared he'd have nothing to do with him.
</p>
<p>
"Then," said the Hon. Tom Dashall, "you may go along Bob."
</p>
<p>
"What! is it possible? I have been looking for you these two hours."
</p>
<p>
"I can't eat pork," said Dashall, resuming his character.
</p>
<p>
"Come along," said Bob, happy to find his relation; and catching him
by the arm, they proceeded to refreshment, and partook of an excellent
supper of cold viands plentifully supplied, and accompanied with a
profusion of ices and jellies, served up in a style highly creditable to
the managers.
</p>
<p>
Here they were joined by Mortimer, who had been as frolicsome as any imp
in the Gardens, in the character of the Devil, but who had lost sight
of the Dandy Officer and the Nun, whom he had so ingeniously hooked
together. The wine was good, and after enjoying their repast, Tom
and Mortimer enshrined themselves in dominos for the remainder of
the evening. The usual masquerade frolics and dancing were afterwards
continued, and about five in the morning they left this region of fun,
mirth and good humour.<span class="pagenum">[417]</span>

</h2>
<pre>
          That Life is a picture of strange things and ways,
          A grand exhibition, each hour displays;
          And for London there's no place can with it compare,
          'Tis a jumble of every thing curious and rare.

</pre>
<p>
THE bustle and merriment of the Masquerade were long remembered in the
mind of Bob Tallyho, and furnished frequent conversations between him
and his Cousin; and the laughable occurrences of the evening, in which
they had been engaged, were re-enjoyed in recollection, notwithstanding
the preparations they were making for an excursion of another kind
in the country, which though not exactly to the taste of Dashall, was
inflexibly persevered in by Tallyho.
</p>
<p>
Tom tried every effort in his power to prolong the appointed period
of departure in A'ain. The heart and mind of his Cousin appeared to
be occupied with anticipated delights, which he described in the most
glowing colours of imagination. The healthful fields, the enlivening fox
chase, and the sportive exercises of a country life, were detailed with
ecstacy; and though last, not least, the additional zest for the more
attractive scenes (in Tom's idea) that would present themselves for
inspection upon a return to the Metropolis. At length it was finally
arranged that their country excursion should not exceed <span class="pagenum">[418]</span> one month
in duration, and that they would leave London time enough to reach
Belville Hall on or before the first day of September.
</p>
<p>
Dashall, after consenting to this arrangement, finding there was not
much time to spare, was anxious to improve it in the pursuit of such
lively and interesting amusements as chance and accident might throw
in their way. "Come," said he, a few mornings after the masquerade, "it
must not be said that you have been so long in London without viewing as
many of its important curiosities as the time would admit; though I am
sure we shall not have an opportunity of glancing at all those I could
point out, and I am pretty sure that persons from the country frequently
see more in a few days residence in the Metropolis, than those who have
inhabited it for their whole lives. We will therefore take a stroll out,
without any determined line of pursuit, and survey what chance may bring
in our way; for the places deserving of particular inspection are so
numerous, and lay in so many directions, that it is scarcely possible
for us to turn round without finding some objects and subjects yet in
store.
</p>
<p>
Thus saying, and taking the arm of his Cousin, they walked along
Piccadilly in a direction for the City; for as it was a clear morning,
Tom, although he had not mentioned the road he meant to take, still had
an object in view.
</p>
<p>
"It is certainly much to be deplored," said he, as they were just
entering Leicester Square by Sydney's Alley, "that the abominable
nuisance of barrows being driven on the pavement cannot be removed; it
is a great shame that lusty and able fellows should be wheeling foul
linen, hogwash, and other filthy articles along the street, to the
annoyance and inconvenience of pedestrians."
</p>
<p>
"I am of your opinion," replied his Cousin; "but during the short time
I have been here, I have discovered many other equally objectionable
annoyances. There is, for instance, the carrying of milk pails, which,
unless great care is taken, are so likely to break people's shins; and
in dirty weather the trundling of boys' hoops, to the discomfiture of
many a well-dressed Lady."
</p>
<p>
At this moment a butcher was passing with a tray heavily loaded, and Bob
narrowly escaped a blow from the projecting corner, which immediately
induced him to add that to the number of what he termed street <span class="pagenum">[419]</span>
grievances, and almost to overturn both the carrier and his load.
</p>
<p>
"A lucky escape," said Dashall, "for you might have lost an eye by
coming in contact with that tray, and I wonder a stop is not put to the
probability of such fatal accidents. It is related that a certain
City Alderman, whose constitution, it may be presumed, is rather of a
combustible nature, by the alarms he spread during his mayoralty, of
the intention to burn the City of London, and destroy all its peaceable
inhabitants, thrashed a butcher who ran against him in the public
street. This it must be admitted was a summary mode of punishment,
although it was not likely to remove the nuisance; but there are still
many that are not enumerated in your list. Both by day and night in
the most frequented streets of the Metropolis and its environs, the
unoffending passengers of either sex are frequently obstructed on, or
absolutely pushed off the pavement by a trio of arm-in-arm puppies;
nay  they will sometimes sweep  the whole of the space from the wall
to the curb stone, by walking four abreast, a practice brutally
infringing the laws of civil society in pedestrian excursions through a
crowded Metropolis.
</p>
<p>
"I have however with pleasure, upon some occasions, seen these vile
trespassers meet with a just resentment in the unexpected pugilistic
exertions of the insulted party; and have almost rejoiced to see them
packed into a coach and sent home with bruises, black eyes, and bloody
noses, serving, it is to be hoped, as wholesome lessons for their future
conduct. In some cases duels have arisen from this violation of decorum
in the King's highway, and by this means, scoundrels have been admitted
to the undeserved honour of being met on a level by gentlemen.
</p>
<p>
"These," continued he, "are the polite encroachers on the pavé.. There
are, however, many others, but of a less censurable, though certainly
of a finable description; such as journeymen bakers wheeling barrows
conveying the staff of life&mdash;publicans' boys collecting pewter
pots&mdash;lady drivers of similar vehicles, containing oysters, inferior or
damaged fruit, delicate prog for pug dogs, cats, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
"After all, the most prominent offenders, or at least obstructors of
the public way, in my opinion, are those sturdy John Bulls, brewers'
servants, by means of ropes <span class="pagenum">[420]</span> and pulleys affixed to their drays,
lowering down beer into, or drawing up empty casks from the cellars of
public-houses. Now although this may be unavoidable, ask one of these
bluff bipeds to let you pass, the consequence frequently will be,
instead of rough civility, an insolent reply accompanied with vulgar
oaths; in short, a torrent of abuse, if not a shove into the kennel;
perhaps a grimy rope thrown against your white stockings. Private,
emolument and convenience certainly ought to give way to public
accommodation."
</p>
<p>
"Confound that dustman's bell," said Bob, as they passed down
Wych-street; "it is as bad as any thing we nave mentioned yet; it
absolutely deafens one."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, if you call noises nuisances, we may go on with a list from this
time to this day month, and scarcely comprehend them. The cries of
London are many of them very laughable, and many very lamentable, and by
way of contrast to the deafening dustman, take care of the bespatterings
from the mud cart. The garlick-eating rogues, the drivers of these
inconvenient conveniences, grinning horribly their ghastly smiles, enjoy
a most malicious pleasure in the opportunities which chance affords
them, of lending a little additional decoration from the contents of
their carts, by way of embellishment to a cleanly dressed passenger.
Therefore keep, if possible, at such a respectful distance as to avoid
the effects of this low envy, and steer clear of the mudlarks."
</p>
<p>
By this time they had passed through the line of leading thoroughfares,
and had St. Paul's in their view, when Tom took occasion to remark, "He
was sorry the scaffolding was not removed, or," continued he, "we would
soon have mounted above these petty considerations, and looked down upon
the world. However, we can take a tolerable survey of the metropolis
from the Monument, and as it is not much farther, we may as well extend
our walk to that celebrated pillar, said to be one of the finest in the
world, and erected by Sir Christopher Wren in memory of the great
fire which in 1666 broke out at a house on the spot, and destroyed the
metropolis from Tower Hill to Temple Bar. From this pillar you will have
a fine panoramic view of London, Westminster, and Southwark; and as we
are about to leave its noise, its bustle, and its inconveniences in a
day or two, we may as well take a general survey."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[421]</span> Bob having signified his consent to this proposal, they made the
best of their way to the Monument, where having deposited the customary
entrance money with the door-keeper, they were allowed to ascend by the
winding staircase to the top, when a prospect was presented to the eye
of Tallyho, of which he could not have formed any previous conception.
The view of the river as far as the eye could reach, each way, the
moving of the boats, the bustle and activity of the streets, and the
continued hum which arose to their ears, formed altogether a subject
of delightful contemplation; while the appearance of being as it were
suspended in the air, rendered it awful and terrific. Bob had almost
grown giddy in his ascension, and for some time took care to keep a
fast hold of the iron railings at top, in order to secure himself from
falling; till Dashall drew from his pocket a telescope, and directed
his attention to Greenwich Hospital, Shooter's Hill, and the public
buildings at a distance, where they were scarcely discernible by the
naked eye. Bob was delighted with the view of Greenwich Hospital, and
the account which his Cousin gave him of the establishment; and upon
descending they took a complete walk round this celebrated pillar,
marking its decorations and reading the inscription.
</p>
<p>
"It is," said Tom, "a fluted column of the Doric order; the total height
is 202 feet, the diameter at the base 15 feet, and the height of the
column 120 feet; the cone at the top, with its urn, are 42 feet; the
height of the massy pedestal is 40 feet; there are 345 steps inside;
but," continued he, ''it is really a great pity that this beautiful
Monument should be in such a confined situation, for in a proper
place it would form one of the most striking objects of the kind that
architecture is capable of producing.
</p>
<p>
"The inscription, it is true," continued Dashall, "had better be erased,
it contains a libel, or more properly a lie, which almost contradicts
itself, for no rational being can entertain the notion that the
Catholics, or indeed any religious sect, could wilfully have perpetrated
so horrible a deed as this pillar was intended to impute to them; nor
can so much credit be given to human foresight as for it to be concluded
that a fire, which broke out in a single house, could upon this, rather
than upon other occasions, have extended its ravages in so extraordinary
a manner.&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[422]</span> While we arc on the spot we will take a peep at a curious piece
of antiquity; not that I am so great a lover of such curiosities, but it
would appear almost unpardonable for you to have been in London without
seeing London Stone."
</p>
<p>
"I have heard of it," said Tallyho, "and if we are near, let us have a
view."
</p>
<p>
"Come on then," said Dashall; "This same London Stone is at present
fixed close under the south wall of St. Swithin's Church, Cannon
Street. It has by some been supposed of British origin, a kind of solemn
boundary, or some other object probably of a religious nature, which
through every change and convulsion of the State has been preserved with
reverential care. But this is the very place," said he.
</p>
<p>
Bob stared about him with surprise, to discover this curious and
apparently valuable relic, without finding it, till at length his
Cousin directed his attention to the spot, which at present is under a
pitching-block, or resting-place for persons carrying heavy loads, and
almost burst into laughter, for he had raised his Cousin's expectation
by the previous description.
</p>
<p>
"How!" said Tallyho, "and is this your curiosity?"
</p>
<p>
"Even so," replied Tom, "that is the celebrated London Stone; it
formerly stood nearer the middle of the street, was placed deep in the
ground, and strongly fixed with iron bars. According to account, the
first mention of it was in the reign of Ethelstan, king of the West
Saxons, and it has been usually viewed by our antiquaries as a military
stone, from which the Romans began the computation of their miles, a
conjecture which certainly appears very reasonable, not only from the
discovery of the Roman road after the year 1666, running directly to
this stone from Watling Street, but from the exact coincidence which its
distance bears with the neighbouring station, mentioned in Antonine's
Itinerary, the principal of whose Journeys either begin or end with
London."
</p>
<p>
The sound of a horn interrupted this conversation.
</p>
<p>
"Apropos," said Tom, "we can take the Post Office in our way, a place of
considerable importance; so allons."
</p>
<p>
They now pursued their way to Lombard Street.
</p>
<p>
"This collection of buildings," said Dashall, as they entered,
"important as its concerns are to the nation, claims no praise as a
building. It stands behind Lombard <span class="pagenum">[423]</span> Street, from which, on the
south side of the street, there is a passage leading to it, under an
arched gateway.
</p>
<p>
"A plan has, however, been adopted for erecting a building worthy of
this great establishment, on the site now called St. Martin's-le-grand,
and to improve the access to it by pulling down the east ends of Newgate
Street and Paternoster-Row. It is now proceeding rapidly.
</p>
<p>
"The Post-office system is, however, one of the most perfect regulations
of finance and convenience existing under any government. It has
gradually been brought to its present perfection, being at first in the
hands of individuals, and replete with abuses. In its present form it
not only supplies the government with a great revenue, but accomplishes
that by means highly beneficial to the persons contributing.
</p>
<p>
"The Post-office is the most important spot on the surface of the globe.
It receives information from all countries; it distributes instructions
to the antipodes; it connects together more numerous and distant
interests of men than any similar establishment. It is in the highest
degree hitherto realized, the seat of terrestrial perception and
volition&mdash;the brain of the whole earth; and hitherto it has been in a
narrow valley, misshapen even to deformity, and scarcely accessible to
the few mail coaches which collect there for their nightly freights.
</p>
<p>
"The present Post-office was erected in 1660; but great additions have
been made to it from time to time, though the whole is disjointed and
inconvenient.
</p>
<p>
"The mode of carrying letters by the General Post was greatly improved
a few years since, by a most admirable plan, invented by Mr. Palmer.
Previously to its adoption, letters were conveyed by carts, without
protection from robbery, and subject to delays. At present they are
carried, according to Mr. Palmer's plan, by coaches, distinguished
by the name of mail-coaches, provided with a well-armed guard, and
forwarded at the rate of eight miles an hour, including stoppages.
Government contracts with coach-keepers merely for carrying the mail,
the coach-owner making a profitable business besides, of carrying
passengers and parcels. It is not easy to imagine a combination of
different interests to one purpose, more complete than this. The
wretched situation, however, of the horses, on account of the length
of the stages which they are frequently driven, is a disgrace to the
character <span class="pagenum">[424]</span> of the British nation, and requires the interference of
the legislature. No stage should exceed twelve miles in length.
</p>
<p>
"The rapidity of this mode of conveyance is unequalled in any country,
and the present rate of charge for each passenger is little more than
sixpence per mile.
</p>
<p>
"Houses having boxes, for receiving letters before five o'clock, are
open in every part of the Metropolis; and after that hour bell-men
collect the, letters during another hour, receiving a fee of one 'penny
for each letter. But, at the General Post-office, in Lombard Street,
letters are received till seven o'clock: after which time, till half an
hour after seven, a fee of sixpence must be paid; and from half after
seven till a quarter before eight, the postage must also be paid, as
well as the fee of sixpence."
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Tallyho, "for a place of such public utility and constant
resort, I must confess I expected to see a building of the most
magnificent kind; but I am also puzzled to conceive how such extensive
business can be carried on with so much regularity as it is."
</p>
<p>
"Your observation," replied his Cousin, "exactly coincides with that
of many others; but you will some day or other be as much surprised
on other subjects, for there are places in London where mercantile and
legal business is conducted in situations of obscurity, of which you can
have no conception; but as a national establishment, though its internal
regulations are good, its external appearance is no recommendation to
it. But come, let us proceed towards home, I have a call or two to make
on the road, for as we depart quickly for the open fields, and are to
bid adieu to London smoke as well as London Stone, we have but little
time to spare, so let us post away."
</p>
<p>
Bob, alive to this subject, did not require a second hint, but taking
the arm of Dashall, they proceeded along Cheapside, made a call at
Mortimer's, the Gun-smith's on Ludgate hill, provided themselves with
all necessary shooting apparatus; and Tom, ever mindful of the variety
which he conceived would be needful to render rusticity agreeable on
their way, purchased a pair of boxing gloves, a backgammon board, and
other amusing articles, to provide, as he said, against a rainy day.
</p>
<p>
On arrival at home, they were presented with a letter from Sparkle,
announcing his arrival at his new mansion, and expressing a hope that he
should have the pleasure of <span class="pagenum">[425]</span> meeting his friends within a day or
two; expatiating with great apparent delight upon the happiness of his
own situation, and promising lots of amusement, in detailing to them the
events of his peregrinations. This operated as an additional spur to the
speed of their departure, and it was agreed that they should start the
next morning.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know," said Bob, "whether I should really like a continued
Life in London; I have seen many of its comforts and many of its
inconveniences." "Then," replied Tom, "you may certainly, by the

to meet them on arrival, and not lose sight of them in their future
rambles.
